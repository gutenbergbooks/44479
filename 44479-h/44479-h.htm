<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Evolution is claimed by its advocates to be the
greatest intellectual discovery of the past century,
and, by some, the greatest thought that ever entered
the mind of man. In the words of its greatest
philosopher, Herbert Spencer, "It spans the
universe and solves the widest range of its problems,
which reach outward through boundless
space, and back through illimitable time, resolving
the deepest problems of life, mind, society,
history and civilization." It has woven into one
great philosophy the history of the material universe,
the entire organic creation, man and all his
faculties, the whole course of human history and
the origin and progress of all religion.</p>

<p>It also undertakes to account for the Bible, for
what is popularly called higher criticism represents
the biblical branch of Evolution. It has reconstructed
the Bible and remanded its miraculous
narratives to the realm of myth. It has
formulated a theology in which the most sacred
doctrines of evangelical belief are discarded. In
its central theory of the origin of man, it vitally
affects the doctrines of the nature of man, of sin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
and penalty, man's need and the work of Christ.
It even touches the person of Christ, for many of
its advocates say that He too comes within its
scope. In its radical and most consistent form,
it utterly discards belief in God. Most of the
great teachers of Evolution, such as Ernst
Haeckel of Jena, are and have been atheists.</p>

<p>It is true that many evolutionists are theistic.
But it is not enough to be theistic. The devil is
"theistic," so was Thomas Paine. Christianity
is far more than theism. It is the grossest sophistry
to teach that because a belief has some truth
in it we must therefore tolerate it. All false doctrine
is sugarcoated with truth. That we are not
overstating the dangerous nature of the theory
will appear from the following opinions of competent
scholars and observers.</p>

<p>Prof. George Frederick Wright, the eminent
geologist, says of Evolution: "It is the fad of the
present, which is making such havoc and confusion
in the thought of the age, leading so many
into intellectual positions, whose conclusions they
dare not face and cannot flank, and from which
they cannot retreat except through the valley of
humiliation." (<cite>Bibliotheca Sacra</cite>, April, 1900.)</p>

<p>Prof. George Howison sounds this alarm: "It
is a portent so threatening to the highest concerns
of man, that we ought to look before we leap and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
look more than once. Under the sheen of the
evolutionary account of man, the world of real
persons, the world of individual responsibility,
disappears; with it disappears the personality of
God." (<cite>Limits of Evolution</cite>, pp. 5, 6.)</p>

<p>There is a vital connection between Facts, Doctrines,
Experiences, Conduct and Prospects.
These successively flow from each other. Christianity
rests on facts, from these we derive doctrines
and from doctrines come experiences,
which give rise to conduct and that ends in suitable
prospects. Facts form the basis of Christianity.
When, therefore, Evolution attacks the
Facts of the Bible, it attempts to undermine the
very basis of all Christianity. President Francis
L. Patton has said: "You may put your philosophy
in one pocket and your religion in another
and think that, as they are separate, they will not
interfere, but that will not work. You have to
bring your theory of the universe and your theory
of religion together. This is the work of this
age."</p>

<p>While all do not go the length of the radical
evolutionists, yet such is the natural working of
the human mind, that this will be its logical conclusion.
If this theory is accepted, we must look
for widespread lapse from all Christian faith and,
as conduct follows belief in all intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
creatures, we shall see also great moral declension.</p>

<p>To the ordinary man, the matter appears in this
light: If we cannot believe a man's statements
we will not take his advice. If we cannot believe
the Bible's narratives why should we believe its
religion? If it is not trustworthy as to facts of
this world, why depend upon it as to the other
world? If it cannot teach correctly the nature of
insects and animals, why should it be able to tell
us the nature of God? The common man reasons
rightly. The Bible must stand or fall by its reliability
all along the line of truth of every kind.</p>

<p>Evolution is being taught, or taken for granted
to-day in high schools, academies, colleges, universities,
and seminaries. It meets the Sunday
School scholar at the first chapter of Genesis.
A busy city pastor says he has been asked about it
every day in the week. It is a living question and
must be met. In every free library are the works
of Spencer, Darwin, Tyndall, Huxley and others,
and these are read continually.</p>

<p>It does seem as if the other side of such a question
ought to be given and considered, if there be
another side, and there certainly is.</p>

<p>The theory of Evolution is being accepted to-day
upon ex-parte evidence. The books on Evolution
are numbered by hundreds, those giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
the other side are few. Many do not even read
for themselves but rely upon the weight of noted
names, or the supposed "consensus of scholarship."</p>

<p>It is even asserted that none but scholars have
the right to discuss the subject. Dr. Lyman
Abbott says in his "Evidences of Christianity"
that "those who are not scientists must be content
to await the final judgment of those who are
experts on this subject, and meanwhile accept tentatively
their conclusions." Not to notice this
demand that we rest on an unfinished theory,
might we not ask permission to accept, "tentatively"
at least, the Bible as it is, while awaiting
the conclusions of scientists as to what we shall
think or believe about it; especially in view of the
fact that all that has been done so far by Christianity
on earth has been effected by the conservative
belief in the Bible.</p>

<p>But non-scientific people are able to comprehend
Evolution. The scientist to-day is able to
state conclusions in language the non-scientific
can readily understand, and the evolutionist himself
tells us we can understand his facts and arguments.
So we who are not scientists may proceed
to investigate a subject in which we have so much
at stake. The questions involved are too important
to be left to the scientist alone. The scientist is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
mainly a witness as to the facts of nature. It is the
duty of the whole body of the intelligent Christian
community, lay and clerical, to generalize
and draw conclusions. These form, as they have
in the past, the court of last resort in such discussions.
The best generalizer will be, not the
scientist whose labors are necessarily confined to
a single science, or even to a department of it,
and who may be even more or less biased by his
environment, but the best juryman will be the
intelligent non-scientific mind. It is before the
judgment seat of Christian Common Sense that
this and all other theories must appear. It is the
man in the pew who says to this pastor, Come,
and he cometh, and to that professor, Go, and
he goeth.</p>

<p>Nor is this examination premature. Evolution
has been now for many years before the public
and its writings fill libraries. We may assume
that the evidence is now before us and, if not all
in, at least enough is given us by which to judge
its nature and probable outcome. This we may
further assume in view of the fact that the advocates
of the theory admit that an increasing number
of facts are not giving increasing evidence
but that their case is more beset with difficulties
than in the day of Darwin, the father of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
hypothesis, or rather, its step-father. So we may
proceed with our examination.</p>

<p>The author of this book makes no claim to
being a scientist. He is simply one of the great
jury to whom this theory appeals. He has, therefore,
here simply considered the evidence and
given herein his conclusions. The facts and arguments
of evolutionary writers will form the chief
source of the examination. Nearly one hundred
writers and works are cited. Out of its own
mouth we will condemn it.</p>

<p>The citations in a book as small as this must be
brief but care has been taken that they are fair as
to the points they are given to show. It is not
claimed that the citations from evolutionary writers
exhibit their opinion on the whole subject but
that they do show their fatal admissions and their
general uncertainty on the whole subject.</p>

<p>It will be shown that Evolution is not accepted
by all scientists and scholars; that it is rejected by
some of the greatest of these; that it is admittedly
an unproven theory; that it has never been verified
and cannot be; that not a single case of evolution
has ever been presented, and that there is
no known cause by which it could take place. Its
arguments will be considered one by one and their
fallacy shown. It will be shown to be, by its own
principles, unscientific and unphilosophical, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
simply a revamping of the old doctrine of Chance
clothed in scientific terms. Finally, it will be
shown that it is violently opposed to the narrative
and doctrines of the Bible and destructive of all
Christian faith; that it originated in heathenism
and ends in atheism.</p>

<p>Much of the material in this book has been presented
by the author in lectures upon the Bible
during Bible institutes and conferences, and he
has been frequently requested to put it in printed
form. He hopes that where the arguments do
not convince, they will at least bring the reader
to what Mr. Gladstone called "that most wholesome
state, a suspended judgment."</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.</h2>


<p>In issuing a third edition of this book it is
proper to state what changes, if any, have
occurred in the discussion.</p>

<p>While the belief in Evolution is wide-spread,
no known cause or causes have yet been discovered
by which the supposed changes in species
occurred, for "Evolution" is not a force or
energy of any kind, but only the name of a theory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
by which the present order of nature is supposed
to have come. The method Darwin proposed
was by Natural Selection arising from the
prodigality of production, the small variations
that occur in living things, the struggle for existence
and the survival of the fittest, aided by
environment and other causes all of which by
slow degrees during infinite ages have produced
the progressive order of species.</p>

<p>This has been decided to be insufficient and
has been abandoned by evolutionary writers. It is
now agreed that the changes must have occurred
in variations originating in the embryo or
in the germ, or in the very substance of which
that is composed. But all this is far beyond
human ken as all writers admit, as follows:
"We are ignorant of the factors which are at
work to produce evolution. We do not even
know whether the life processes are conducted in
accordance with the principles of chemistry and
physics, or are in obedience to some more subtle
vital principle." (Metcalf, <cite>Organic Evolution</cite>.)
President David Starr Jordan and Prof. Vernon
Lyman Kellogg, both of Stanford University,
say: "These changes or variations, if they do
occur, cannot be explained." (<cite>Evolution and
Animal Life, p. 112.</cite>)</p>

<p>This is universally admitted by scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
writers and the search is now for some proof
for Evolution along these lines. But as President
Jordan makes the still greater confession
that "science does not comprehend a single elemental
fact of nature," and such writers as the
late Lord Kelvin, president of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science, agree
thereto, the required proof seems far off.</p>

<p>So the discussion is in even a less tangible
state than in Darwin's time, for that had a theory
supposed to be sufficient, but now there is no
known cause which can be demonstrated or offers
the slightest explanation, as admitted above by
these leading writers.</p>

<p>The facts which are advanced to support the
theory are dealt with in this volume and their
fallacy shown, that all may be explained without
reverting to such an unproven theory as
Evolution.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>BY PROF. GEORGE FREDERICK WRIGHT
OF OBERLIN COLLEGE.</h3>


<p>The doctrine of Evolution as it is now
becoming current in popular literature is one-tenth
bad Science and nine-tenths bad Philosophy.
Darwin was not strictly an Evolutionist,
and rarely used the word. He endeavored
simply to show that Species were enlarged
varieties. The title of his epoch making book
was, "The Origin of Species by Natural Selection."
On the larger questions of the origin
of genera and the more comprehensive orders
of plants and animals, he spoke with great
caution and only referred to such theories as
things "dimly seen in the distance."</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer, however, came in with his
sweeping philosophical theory of the Evolution
of all things through natural processes,
and took Darwin's work in a limited field as a
demonstration of his philosophy. It is this
philosophy which many popular writers and
teachers, and some thoughtless Scientific men
have taken up and made the center of their
systems. But the most of our men of Science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
are modest in their expressions upon such
philosophical themes. Herbert Spencer does
not rank among the great men of Science of
the day. Lord Kelvin's recent remarks upon
the subject are most truthful and significant.
(See below pp. 18, 24.)</p>

<p>Mr. Patterson does well to emphasize the
fact that <em>orderly succession</em> does not necessarily
imply <em>evolution from resident forces</em>. The
orderly arrangements of a business house
proceed from the activity of a number of free
wills, each of which might do differently, but
act in a definite manner, through voluntary
adherence to a single purpose. God is all wise
and good as well as all powerful. His plan
of Creation will therefore be consistent whatever
be the means through which he accomplishes
it.</p>

<p>Mr. Patterson, also, does well to dwell upon
the "uncertainties of Science." Inductive
Science looks but a short distance either into
space or time, and has no word concerning
either the beginning of things or the end of
things. Upon these points the Inspired Word
is still our best and our only authority. While
not saying that all the points in this little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
volume are well taken, I can say that I disagree
with fewer things in it than with those in
almost any other on the subject, and that it is
fitted to serve as a very needful tonic in these
days of the confusion of bad Philosophy and
fragmentary Science.</p>

<p>Before entering upon the discussion we need to
enquire as to the meaning of the word "Evolution"
as applied to the theory. We must also ask
a definition of the theory as given by its best-known
writers; and also enquire as to the spheres
it claims to cover. To clearly state a question is
often half the task of solving it.</p>


<h3>MEANING OF EVOLUTION.</h3>

<p>We must distinguish between the ordinary conversational
sense of the word Evolution and the
technical use of the term as designating a theory
by that name. We speak of the evolution of the
seed into the plant and the further evolution of
the flower and the fruit, meaning by our words
merely the natural progressive action of the life
within the plant. This principle the evolutionist
applies to the whole universe which he says came
in a similar way.</p>

<p>Again we use the word Evolution to describe
any succession of things which show progress.
Such an instance is given us in the change in appliances
for the use of steam from the time when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
its power was first observed in the lifting lid of
the tea-kettle to the time when it drives the latest
ocean liner. This is, however, simply the succession
of a series of things in advancing order, but
without vital connection. Their real relation is
outside of themselves in the minds of the inventors
who, in turn, may be many and widely separated.
Succession is not Evolution nor does it
prove or imply such a process. That demands
an intimate and genetic connection between the
things as they appear, the higher growing out of
the substance of the lower in physical things and
the intellectual likewise.</p>

<p>The theory of Evolution asserts that from a
nebulous mass of primeval substance, whose origin
it never attempts to account for, there came
by natural processes, as a flower from a bud, and
fruit from the flower, all that we see and know in
the heavens above and the earth beneath.</p>

<p>Tyndall's statement of the scope of the theory
is as follows: "Strip it naked and you
stand face to face with the notion, that
not only the ignoble forms of life, the
animalcular and animal life, not only the more
noble forms of the horse and lion, not only the
exquisite mechanism of the human body, but the
human mind with its emotions, intellect, will and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
all their phenomena, were latent in that fiery
cloud." (<cite>Christianity and Positivism</cite>, p. 30.)</p>

<p>Dr. Lyman Abbott further defines its application
to man thus: "Evolution is the doctrine that
this life of man, this moral, this ethical, this
spiritual nature has been developed by natural
processes." (<cite>Theology of an Evolutionist.</cite>)</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer's celebrated definition is as follows:
"Evolution is a progress from the homogeneous
to the heterogeneous, from general to
special, from the simple to the complex elements
of life." But we deny the right to apply this definition
exclusively to the theory of Evolution. Creation
also proceeds on the same order, so also
does manufacture or any other intelligent operation.</p>

<p>The clearest account of the theory is that given
by Prof. Le Conte, as follows: "All things came
(1) by continuous progressive changes, (2) according
to certain laws, (3) by means of resident
forces." (<cite>Evolution and Religious Thought.</cite>) It
is the latter clause in which the real meaning
of the theory lies. These "resident forces" include
exterior influences such as food, climate,
etc.</p>

<p>The theories of Evolution are as many as the
respective writers. Each one has his own theory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
as to the scope and cause and operation of it all.
Theistic Evolution allows the intervention of God
at the creation of the primeval "fire-mist" and
at the origin of life and the production of man's
spiritual nature. The atheist denies any interference
of a Creator at all. Haeckel says the best
definition of Evolution is "the non-miraculous
origin and progress of the universe." He and
many others say that if the Creator is admitted
at any point, He may as well be admitted all
along. This is consistent Evolution.</p>

<p>The theistic and the atheistic evolutionist however
agree in saying that man was descended from
the brute, as to his body at least, and some even,
as above shown, claim this descent for the whole
man. This doctrine as to man is the vital part of
the whole theory and in this all evolutionists are
practically agreed. So that so far as their effect
on Christian doctrine and Bible fact is concerned,
all may be classed together.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>EVOLUTION AS AN UNPROVEN THEORY.</h3>


<p>With perhaps the exception of Prof. Ernst
Haeckel of Jena, all evolutionists admit that Evolution
is unproven. One of the latest writers,
and most impartial, is Prof. H. W. Conn, who
says in his "Evolution of To-day:" "Nothing
has been positively proved as to the question at
issue. From its very nature, Evolution is beyond
proof.... The difficulties offered to an unhesitating
acceptance of Evolution are very great,
and have not grown less since the appearance of
Darwin's <cite>Origin of Species</cite>, but have in some respects
grown greater." (pp. 107, 203.) He
makes many such admissions. Dr. Rudolph
Schmidt writes, "All these theories have not
passed beyond the rank of hypotheses." (<cite>Theories
of Darwin</cite>, p. 61.) Prof. Whitney, of Yale
University, says, "We cannot think the theory
yet converted into a scientific fact and those are
perhaps the worst foes to its success who are
over-hasty to take it and use it as a proved fact."
(<cite>Oriental and Linguistic Studies, pp. 293-4</cite>)
Tyndall said: "Those who hold the doctrine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Evolution are by no means ignorant of the uncertainty
of their data, and they only yield to it a
provisional assent." (<cite>Fragments of Science</cite>, p.
162.) Dr. J. A. Zahm writes: "The theory of
Evolution is not yet proved by any demonstrative
evidence. An absolute demonstration is impossible."
(<cite>Popular Science Monthly</cite>, April, 1898.)
Huxley said, "So long as the evidence at present
adduced falls short of supporting the affirmative,
the doctrine must be content to remain among the
hypotheses." (<cite>Lay Sermons</cite>, p. 295.) Down to
the end of his life, he said the evidence for Evolution
was insufficient. (<cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, January,
1901.)</p>

<p>This universal admission will be a surprise to
the non-scientific, especially in view of the astounding
and sweeping claims the theory has
made. It will seem strange that a confessedly unproven
theory should be made the basis of all
"modern thinking," the foundation of a universal
philosophy, the cause of a revolution in theology,
and the reason for rejecting the narratives of the
Bible, and, on the part of some, of abandoning
Christianity and launching into atheism. Yet
such is the case. Well may we draw a long breath
here and say, Is this Science? Is it scientific to
accept as true an unproven theory and make it
the basis of all belief? We have even more startling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
facts to present as to this amazing form of
unbelief.</p>

<p>In discussing Evolution, we must also continually
distinguish between fact and theory, between
things proven and assumed. For the
writers continually intermingle these in a confusing
way. We need ever to ask concerning its
statements, Is this proven or assumed? The jury
have a right to ask that everything be proved absolutely
before rendering a verdict for Evolution.</p>


<h3>EVOLUTION IS NOT ACCEPTED BY ALL SCIENTISTS
AND SCHOLARS.</h3>

<p>The statement is often made that Evolution has
"the Consensus of Scholarship." This carries
force to the non-scientific, indeed to all, for we
must rest our faith, for facts at least, on the opinion
of scientists. But while many have followed
it, there remain many scholars who have not
bowed the knee to Baal. Prof. Haeckel, its greatest
living advocate, complains bitterly of the opposition
of many of the scientists of Europe, and
that many once with him have deserted him.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Virchow, the great pathologist and
the discoverer of the germ theory, was an active
opponent of Evolution. He says: "The reserve
which most naturalists impose on themselves is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
supported by the small actual proofs of Darwin's
theory. Facts seem to teach the invariability of
the human and the animal species." (<cite>Popular
Science</cite>, pp. 50, 52.) Dr. Groette, in his inaugural
address as rector of the University of Strasburg,
rejected Evolution.</p>

<p>Dr. D. S. Gregory of New York, editor of the
Homiletic Review and in a position to know the
facts, vouches for the statement, that, "It is a
strange fact that no great scientific authority in
Great Britain in exact science, science that reduces
its conclusions to mathematical formulae,
has endorsed Evolution."</p>

<p>The late Dr. J. H. W. Stuckenberg, of Cambridge,
wrote me, that many of the scientists of
Germany reject the extreme views of Evolution,
and the inferences which men like Prof. Haeckel,
of Jena, have drawn from Darwinism. He quotes
Dr. W. Haecke, a zoologist of Jena, the home of
Prof. Haeckel, as saying: "We the younger men
must free ourselves from the Darwinian dogma,
in which respect quite a number of us have been
quite successful." Prof. Paulsen, of Berlin, has
exposed some of Haeckel's fallacies and regards
his reasoning as "a disgrace to Germany." He said
the mechanical theory for which Darwinism was
held to stand, is rejected by such scientists as
Naegeli, Koelliker, M. Wagner, Snell, Fovel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Bunge, the physiological chemist, A. Brown,
Hoffman and Askernazy, botanists; Oswald Heer,
the geologist, and Otto Hamann, the zoologist.
Of Carl Ernst von Baer, the eminent zoologist
and anthropologist, Haecke affirms, that in early
years he came near adopting the hypothesis of
Evolution into his system, but that at a later date
he utterly rejected it. The same change occurred
in the late Du Bois Reymond and Prof. Virchow,
the eminent scientist of the University of Berlin.
(See also articles of Dr. Stuckenberg in <cite>Homiletic
Review</cite>, January, 1901, May, 1902.)</p>

<p>Sir J. William Dawson, the great geologist of
Canada, utterly rejected it and says: "It is one
of the strangest phenomena of humanity; it is
utterly destitute of proof." (<cite>Story of the Earth
and Man</cite>, p. 317.) Dr. Etheridge, examiner of
the British Museum, said to Dr. George E. Post,
in answer to a question, "In all this great museum,
there is not a particle of evidence of the
transmutation of species. This museum is full
of proofs of the utter falsity of these views."
Thomas Carlyle called Evolution "the gospel of
dirt." Ruskin said of it, "I have never yet heard
one logical argument in its favor. I have heard
and read many that are beneath contempt." (<cite>The
Eagles Nest</cite>, p. 256.)</p>

<p>Prof. Z&#246;ckler writes: "It must be stated that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the supremacy of this philosophy has not been
such as was predicted by its defenders at the outset.
A mere glance at the history of the theory
during the four decades that it has been before
the public shows that the beginning of the end is
at hand."</p>

<p>Such utterances are now very common in the
periodicals of Germany, it is said. It seems plain
the reaction has commenced and that the pendulum
that has swung so strongly in the direction
of Evolution, is now oscillating the other way. It
required twenty years for Evolution to reach
us from abroad. Is it necessary for us to wait
twenty years more to reverse our opinions? Why
may we not pass upon facts for ourselves without
awaiting the "Consensus of European Scholarship,"
which is after all so subject to perplexing
reversals? It makes plain people dizzy to attempt
to follow leaders of opinion who change with
every wind that blows across the ocean.</p>

<p>Many citations will appear in the following
pages which show the strong exceptions taken by
leading scholars against the theory in whole or in
part. Indeed, as said already, the arguments to
be given herein against Evolution are drawn from
the statements of leading evolutionists themselves.
Some of these are earlier opinions and some their
latest utterances. In every case the state of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
discussion will be shown to be far from that
"Consensus of Scholarship" so airily claimed by
the writers on the subject and so unhesitatingly
accepted by their followers.</p>

<p>It may be objected that some of these authorities
are dead and that later scholars differ from
them. Not to mention the names of still living
writers named above, let us remark that all wisdom
is not left to our day. Socrates and Bacon
are dead, yet their opinions are still of value.
Moses is dead, yet the Ten Commandments are
still believed if not obeyed. Our present evolutionary
writers will also one day be dead, yet they
hope even then to be given some credit for sense
and science. The "consensus of scholarship"
ought to include wisdom past as well as present.</p>

<p>It is also to be remembered that there are thousands
of quiet thinkers who have never given in
their adhesion to this startling theory, and more,
that the great masses of the church at least, have
no confidence in it. Those preparing to launch
their ships upon this current had better, as a matter
of common prudence at least, wait a while at
least till the mists have rolled away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<h3>DISCARDED THEORIES OF THE PAST.</h3>

<p>Prof. George Frederick Wright says, "The history
of science is little else than one of discarded
theories.... The so-called science of the present
day is largely going the way so steadily followed
in the past. The things about which true science
is certain are very few and could be contained in
a short chapter of a small book." (<cite>The Advance</cite>,
May 12, 1902.)</p>

<p>It is sometimes charged to the church that it
has held theories which the discoveries of science
have shown to be untrue. But it must be borne
in mind that these false theories were just as
firmly held by the scientists of the day as by the
church.</p>

<p>Dr. Andrew White has written two great volumes
on the warfare between science and theology.
He might write many and larger volumes
on the wars between the theories of science.
Every one of these discarded theories, and they
are numbered by thousands, has been the center
of terrific conflicts.</p>

<p>Galileo's discovery of the satellites of Jupiter
was opposed by his fellow astronomers, who even
refused to look at them through his telescope. Dr.
J. A. Zahm quotes Cardinal Wiseman as saying
that the French Institute in 1860 could count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
more than eighty theories opposed to Scripture,
not one of which has stood still or deserves to be
recorded. At a meeting of the British Association,
Sir William Thomson announced that he
believed life had come to this globe by a meteor.
His theory lived less than a year. Mr. Huxley
said that the origin of life was a sheet of gelatinous
living matter which covered the bottom of the
ocean. This theory had even a shorter life.
Among the most recent reversals of this kind is
that of a universally held theory, namely, that
coral reefs are built up by the coral insects in their
desire to keep near the surface as the ocean's bottom
sinks. Prof. A. Agassiz has just demolished
this theory.</p>

<p>Scholars were unanimous a short time ago that
Troy was a myth. But Dr. Schliemann's great
discoveries have overthrown that "consensus of
scholarship." Prof. Harnack, one of the greatest
of critics in his great work, <cite>The Chronology of
the Christian Scriptures</cite>, admits that science,
meaning Higher Criticism, has made many mistakes
and has much to repent of. Joseph Cook
said, "Within the memory of man yet comparatively
young, the mythical theory of Strauss has
had its rise, its fall, its burial."</p>

<p>The thirty thousand citizens of St. Pierre on
Martinique, trusting in the assurances of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
scientists, remained in their fated city and the
next day were overwhelmed in the most awful
calamity of modern times.</p>

<p>We may consider in this connection the dissatisfaction
of some of the greatest minds of evolutionary
circles with the results of their own theory.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert Spencer is thus quoted, writing in
his eighty-third year: "The intellectual man, who
occupies the same tenement with me, tells me that
I am but a piece of animated clay equipped with
a nerve system and in some mysterious way connected
with the big dynamo called the world;
but that very soon now the circuit will be cut and
I will fall into unconsciousness and nothingness.
Yes I am sad, unutterbly sad, and I wish in my
heart I had never heard of the intellectual man
with his science, philosophy and logic." (<cite>Facts
and Comments.</cite>)</p>

<p>Prof. Frederic Harrison, the agnostic, thus
writes: "The philosophy of evolution and demonstration
promised but it did not perform. It
raised hopes, but it led to disappointment. It
claimed to explain the world and to direct man,
but it left a great blank. That blank was the field
of religion, of morality, of the sanctions of deity.
It left the mystery of the future as mysterious as
ever and yet as imperative as ever. Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
philosophy of nature it offered, it gave no adequate
philosophy of Man. It was busy with the
physiology of Humanity and propounded inconceivable
and repulsive guesses about the origin
of Humanity." (<cite>North American Review</cite>, December,
1900, p. 825.)</p>

<p>From the opposite side of the field, President
Woodrow Wilson writes: "This is the dis-service
scientific study has done for us; it has given
us agnosticism in the realm of philosophy, scientific
anarchism in the field of politics. It has made
the legislator confident that he can create and the
philosopher sure that God cannot." (<cite>Forum</cite>,
December, 1896.)</p>


<h3>UNCERTAINTY OF SCIENTIFIC THEORIES IN GENERAL.</h3>

<p>Another feature which strikes the non-scientific
mind curiously is the wide differences among
great scientists as to the facts of nature. The age
of the earth is variously declared to be ten million
years by some, and by others equally able, a
thousand million years. The temperature of its
interior is stated to be 1,530 degrees by one, and
350,000 degrees by another. Herschel calculated
the mountains on the moon to be half a mile high,
Ferguson said they were fifteen miles high. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
height of the Aurora Borealis is guessed from two
and a half to one hundred and sixty miles, and its
nature is still more widely described. The delta
at the mouth of the Mississippi was calculated by
Lyell to have been 100,000 years in forming.
Gen. Humphrey, of the United States survey, estimated
it at 4,000 years, and M. Beaument at
1,300 years.</p>

<p>The deposits of carbonate of lime on the floor
of Kent Cavern in England have been estimated
by different scientists to have been from a thousand
to a million years in forming.</p>

<p>The discovery of radium and other similar
substances, it is said, is almost revolutionizing the
theories of the constitution of matter and affecting
all physical science.</p>

<p>These facts are not cited to discredit science.
No one in his senses would fail to acknowledge
our great debt to the earnest and laborious workers
in these varying fields. But these instances
of many such are cited to show that there is need
for caution in accepting proposed theories.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE AND EARTH.</h3>


<p>In undertaking to account for the universe,
Evolution faces four problems. 1. The origin of
matter. 2. The origin of force. 3. The formation
and orderly arrangement of the universe. 4.
The origin of life. In all of these it fails; it confesses
its failure in the first two and last, and
makes ludicrous attempts to explain the third. We
will consider each in turn.</p>

<p>1. Evolution fails to account for the origin of
matter. Spencer says this is the Unknowable.
So that Spencer's great philosophy rests on what
he doesn't know and cannot find out. Darwin said
as to the origin of things, "I am in a hopeless
muddle." Prof. Edward Clodd wrote: "Of the
beginning of what was before the present state of
things, we know nothing and speculation is futile,
but since everything points to the finite duration
of the present creation, we must make a start
somewhere." (<cite>Story of Creation</cite>, p. 137.) Science
is what we know. Therefore Evolution rests
upon an unscientific foundation. Nor is there any
other account conceivable than that the Bible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
gives. As long as this first and fundamental fact
is not solved, the theory must be content to be at
most a limited one, and far from being that
sweeping discovery which its advocates assert it
to be.</p>

<p>2. Evolution fails to account for the origin of
Force. The great forces which animate the universe,
such as gravity, heat, motion and light,
must be accounted for by this theory to give it the
standing it demands. It makes no attempt to do
this. Evolution is silent when we ask, Whence
came these mighty forces? Calling them Laws of
Nature does not answer the question. Laws need
law makers and enforcers also. Laws do not enforce
themselves. As forces, they show the ceaseless
giving out of energy. Where is the dynamo
from which this perpetual energy originated and
still proceeds?</p>

<p>In this connection, let us notice the reticence
and limitations of really great scientists as to the
nature of these energies. Lord Kelvin, the greatest
living scientist, said at the meeting of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science,
of which he was president: "One word characterizes
the most strenuous of the efforts for the
advancement of science that I have made perseveringly
for fifty-five years. That word is failure.
I know no more of electric and magnetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
force, or of the relation between ether, electricity
and ponderable matter, or of chemical affinity,
than I knew and tried to teach to my students of
natural philosophy fifty years ago in my first session
as professor."</p>

<p>Haeckel himself, the greatest living evolutionist,
admits: "We grant at once that the innermost
character of nature is just as little understood
by us as it was by Anaximander and Empedocles
2,400 years ago.... We grant that the
essence of substance becomes more mysterious
and enigmatic the more deeply we penetrate into
the knowledge of its attributes." (<cite>Riddle of the
Universe.</cite>)</p>

<p>3. Evolution fails to account for the orderly
movements of the heavenly bodies which have
the accuracy of a chronometer, aye, which are the
standards by which all chronometers are regulated,
so that the astronomer can calculate to a
second when the heavenly bodies shall pass any
particular point of view or form their many conjunctions.
There is no collision, no noise. "There
is no speech nor language, their voice is not
heard."</p>

<p>Our Solar System is unique in the heavens.
Prof. See tells us there is no other like it in the
regularity of its orbits, and in its distant position
from the powerful attractions of the mighty systems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of the heavens. The earth, too, is the only
world so far known to be advanced enough for
the production of life. Its situation is far enough
from the sun to be beyond its powerful heat and
electric energy and yet near enough to preserve
and continue all life. The arrangement of its
surface into land and water proportions gives the
requisite amount of moisture over the land areas.
The atmosphere is mixed of gases in just the
right proportions for life. All this speaks as loudly
as any mechanism can speak, of intention and
benevolence and control and careful adjustment;
far from that haphazard effect which comes from
the undirected working of "resident forces."</p>

<p>Evolution declares the universe began with a
nebulous mass, which Tyndall says was "fire-mist,"
and contracted as it became cold; but Spencer
says it was a cold cloud which became heated
as it contracted. We are left to the perplexity of
deciding for ourselves which theory we will accept.
This is only one of many such contradictions
we shall meet. But however, or whatever it
was, it organized itself into the wonderful universe
of stars by a rotary motion which the contraction
produced, and this threw off portions as
a carriage wheel throws off mud, each portion
taking up a similar motion and cooling in a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
fashion until it became cool enough for living
things.</p>

<p>Proof for all this is supposed to be seen in a
nebula which is seen in the constellation Orion,
which has a spiral form and is supposed to be a
world in the making.</p>

<p>But in February, 1901, a new star appeared
surrounded by a nebula and this in rapid motion
from the center. This sudden appearance of a
world in a nebulous state seems like the reversing
of the evolutionary process or indeed like a world
being destroyed and reduced to its first estate.
Other facts are also contradictory, such as the
motion or revolution of some of the satelites in a
reverse order from that demanded by the theory.</p>

<p>Indeed the whole nebular theory is now being
called in question.</p>

<p>Prof. George Frederick Wright of Oberlin
University, thus writes of it:</p>

<p>"The nebular hypothesis, which all forms of
evolution now assume for a beginning, involves
the supposition that the molecules of matter composing
the solar system were originally diffused
through space like the particles of mist in a vast
fogbank, and that then, under the action of gravitation,
they began to approach each other and to
collect in masses, which began to revolve about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
their axes and to move in orbits around the center
of attraction. Every step in this supposition involves
an added mystery. The existence of the
molecules in their original diffused state is but
the beginning of the mystery, though that is
utterly incomprehensible.</p>

<p>"The power of gravitation which compels the
separated particles to approach each other is an
utter mystery, which has completely baffled all
efforts at explanation by scientific men. The
revolution of the various masses of the solar system
on their axes and in their orbits is another
mystery for which there is no solution.</p>

<p>"Thus is the thorough-going evolutionist at
every point confronted with an insoluble mystery,
and he deceives himself if he fancies that he has
discovered anything which will take the place of
the Christian's conception of God as the creator,
sustainer and ruler of all things." (<cite>Record-Herald</cite>,
Chicago, Dec. 24, 1902.)</p>

<p>Other facts are even more perplexing to this
theory. The moon is moving from her place at
an increasing rate and astronomy cannot account
for it. The earth's axis of revolution has varied
from time to time. Only one star in a thousand
has ever been catalogued. Of only about a hundred
is the calculation of the parallax possible, so
distant are they.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>As to our earth, a well-known writer says: "No
one of standing in the scientific world of to-day
is willing to go on record as having a theory of
his own regarding the internal fires of this planet
or attempting to account for their origin."</p>

<p>In view of this state of uncertainty, it seems to
the non-scientific mind hazardous to project
across these vast ages a guess as to what the conditions
were and how the universe originated.
And above all to found on this guess a vast philosophy
of the universe affecting all we hold
precious for this life and that to come. Well may
we hesitate before such demands.</p>

<p>4. The origin of life is a problem Evolution has
sought in vain to solve or account for by its
natural or resident forces.</p>

<p>Prof. Le Conte labors hard to show that it
might have come from the union of the four gases,
carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, under
some peculiar circumstances. If he had said
under the direct act of the Creator we could assent
cheerfully. For these do enter into the substance
which forms the bodies of living things. But the
claim of Evolution is that all came by "resident
forces," self-operating. Once admit the direct act
of the Creator, and, as Haeckel says, they might
as well admit it along the whole process, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
argument for a single instance is valid for the
whole. So they will have none of it.</p>

<p>Prof. Le Conte labors to show that protoplasm
might be self-originating, but Prof. Conn says,
"Protoplasm is not a chemical compound but a
mechanism.... Unorganized protoplasm
does not exist.... It could never have been
produced by chemical process. Chemistry has
produced starches, fats, albumens, but not protoplasm."
(<cite>Method of Evolution.</cite>)</p>

<p>Lord Kelvin, in writing to the <cite>London Times</cite>,
said:</p>

<p>"Forty years ago I asked Liebig, walking somewhere
in the country, if he believed that the grass
and flowers which we saw around us grew by
mere chemical forces. He answered, 'No, no more
than I could believe that a book of botany describing
them could grow by mere chemical
forces.'"</p>

<p>Tyndall, after laborious experiments during
eight months, thus candidly states the result,
in an address before the Royal Institute, London:
"From the beginning to the end of the inquiry,
there is not, as you have seen, a shadow of evidence
in favor of the doctrine of spontaneous
generation.... In the lowest, as in the
highest of organized creatures, the method of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
nature is, that life shall be the issue of antecedent
life."</p>

<p>And Mr. Huxley also admitted, "The doctrine
that life can only come from life is victorious all
along the line." Prof. Conn states, "There is not
the slightest evidence that living matter could
arise from non-living matter. Spontaneous generation
is universally given up." (<cite>Evolution of
To-day</cite>, p. 26.)</p>

<p>Wilson, the great authority on the cell says,
"The study of the cell has seemed to expand
rather than narrow the enormous gap that separates
even the lowest forms of life from the inorganic
world." (<cite>The Cell in Development and Inheritance</cite>,
p. 330.)</p>

<p>Here then, is the greatest chasm of all: Evolution
fails at the very start in the story of life. Yet
this is its chosen field. On this depends the whole
theory. If there was a Creator at the origin of
life, why not at the origin of all living things?
It is simply a question of degree. The making of
a single cell, the simplest creature that lives, is as
great a mystery as that of man. Conceptually the
one is as possible as the other.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE EVOLUTION OF SPECIES.</h3>


<p>This is Evolution's great field of labor. It was
this which mainly occupied Darwin's labors and
is the basis of the whole sweeping theory. This
suggested man's animal origin and all that follows
as to man's history and religion and civilization.
So that this is the basal part of Evolution.
Yet against this fundamental argument, two
great charges are made and admitted: First, not
a single case of evolution of species is known, and,
second, no law or force by which such changes
could take place has been discovered. We will
consider these two fatal defects.</p>


<h3>NOT A SINGLE INSTANCE OF EVOLUTION IS KNOWN.</h3>

<p>In support of this assertion we might quote the
admissions of nearly every evolutionary writer.
Prof. Winchell writes upon this point as follows:</p>

<p>"The great stubborn fact which every form of
the theory encounters at the very outset is, that
notwithstanding variations, we are ignorant of a
single instance of the derivation of one good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
species from another. The world has been ransacked
for an example, and occasionally it has
seemed for a time as if an instance had been found
of the origination of a genuine species by so-called
natural agencies, but we only give utterance
to the admissions of all the recent advocates of
derivation theories, when we announce that the
long-sought <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">experimentum crucis</i> has not been
discovered." (<cite>The Doctrine of Evolution</cite>, p. 54.)</p>

<p>Prof. Conn, in one of the most recent works
upon Evolution, says: "It is true enough that
naturalists have been unable to find a single unquestioned
instance of a new species.... It
will be admitted at the outset on all sides, that no
unquestioned instance has been observed of one
species being derived from another.... It
is therefore impossible at present to place the
question beyond dispute." (<cite>Evolution of To-day</cite>,
p. 23.)</p>

<p>Here then is a fatal defect. The world has been
ransacked for evidence, the museums are full of
specimens, the secrets of nature have been explored
in every land, the minutest creatures discovered
and analyzed. We have the remains of
animals and plants of many kinds thousands of
years old, such as the mummied remains from
Egypt, and yet not a single instance of the change
Evolution asserts has ever been known! Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
this change of species is the fundamental argument
of Evolution. On this rests its theory of the
origin of man and all that flows from that assertion,
and this basal assertion is absolutely without
an actual instance of fact.</p>

<p>The changes in certain species such as roses,
primroses, tomatoes, pigeons and dogs, are not
new species, but only varieties, having none of
the traits of species, easily intermingling, propagating,
and readily reverting to their original
forms, changes which true species are not susceptible
of. Darwin admitted that the continued fertility
of these varieties was one of his greatest
difficulties. One of the definitions of species is
that they will not interbreed and propagate. So
that hybrids are sterile. "After its kind," is the
primal law of nature, and as Dr. Jesse B. Thomas
says, "The stubborn mule still blocks the way of
Evolution."</p>


<h3>NO CAUSE OF EVOLUTION IS KNOWN.</h3>

<p>Evolution is not a force. There is no power
or cause which is known as Evolution. The word
simply describes the order in which things have
been supposed to come. We must draw a clear
line of distinction between Cause and Order of
Appearance. There is a certain order in the succession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of living things as they came, but what
caused that order is the very question at issue.
The Duke of Argyle warns against confusing
these when he says, "Evolution puts forward a
visible order of phenomena as a complete and all-sufficient
account of its own origin and cause."
(<cite>Theories of Darwin.</cite>)</p>

<p>The absence of an agreed cause is admitted by
evolutionists. Huxley says, "The great need of
Evolution is a theory of derivation." (<cite>Man's
Place in Nature.</cite>) Darwin admits, "Our ignorance
of the laws of derivation is profound."
(<cite>Descent of Man.</cite>) "The laws governing inheritance
are for the most part unknown."
(<cite>Origin of Species.</cite>) Prof. Conn in <cite>Evolution of
To-day</cite>, says, "No two scientists are agreed as
to what is the cause of the supposed changes of
species." (p. 337.) Prof. Clodd traces it to the
protoplasm which forms the germ and ends his
exhaustive treatise by saying the cause is still
unknown. (<cite>Method of Evolution.</cite>)</p>

<p>Darwin's theory was Natural Selection. It is
this which is technically called "Darwinism,"
although some writers apply that name to the general
subject of Evolution. Natural selection is the
theory that inasmuch as minute variations occur
in the struggle of living things for existence, the
variations which would prove favorable to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
welfare of the animal would be transmitted to its
progeny and be increased and so, in many generations,
the accumulating effects, aided by climate,
food, sexual selection, and other causes, would
amount to a new species. Prof. Conn says of this
theory, "Natural selection is almost universally
acknowledged as insufficient to meet the facts of
nature, since many facts of life cannot be explained
by it." (p. 243.)</p>

<p>Mr. Huxley said long before: "After much consideration,
and with assuredly no bias against Mr.
Darwin's views, it is our clear conviction that as
the evidence now stands it is not absolutely proved
that a group of animals, having all the characteristics
exhibited by species in nature, has ever been
originated by selection, whether natural or artificial."
(<cite>Lay Sermons</cite>, 295.)</p>

<p>The theories as to what produced the supposed
changes are as many as the writers on Evolution.
Prof. Conn says, "All agreement disappears.
Each thinker has his own views." And adds,
"Thus far we have seen no indication of the manner
in which this evolution has been manifested."
(p. 20.) Prof. J. Arthur Thomson, lecturer on
zoology in the School of Medicine, Edinburgh,
said: "Unless we can give some theory of the
origin of variations we have no material for
further consideration. Unfortunately we are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
ignorant about the whole matter." The various
writers ascribe the changes to food, climate, sexual
selection, extraordinary births, isolation and
many other supposed causes. All these have been
in turn combatted by other evolutionist writers,
and the war goes on and has produced libraries of
volumes. It is around this that the conflict rages
and the war is a merry one.</p>


<h3>HOW EVOLUTION ORIGINATED SPECIES.</h3>

<p>It is when Evolution gives the particulars of
these changes that it becomes especially interesting.
We will, by way of lighting up the examination,
consider a few of the stories it tells us as to
how things came.</p>

<p>Spencer tells us how the backbone came to be,
for the primitive animals had none. Prof. Conn
quotes his account as follows: "He thinks the
segmentation, the division of the spinal column
into vertebrae, arose as the result of strains. Originally
the vertebrate was unsegmented, but in
bending its body from side to side in locomotion
through the water, its spinal column became divided
by the action of simple mechanical force."
(<cite>Evolution of To-day</cite>, p. 65.) Thus what we
usually consider a serious calamity, the breaking
of one's backbone, became one of the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
blessings, for what would we be without flexible
backs, with which to follow the meanderings of
Evolution?</p>

<p>Evolution also tells us how legs originated. The
earliest animals were without legs. Some animal
in this legless state found on its body some slight
excrescences or warts, which aided materially its
progress as it wiggled along, and thus it acquired
the habit of using these convenient warts. This
habit it transmitted to its posterity and they increased
the habit until the excrescences, lengthened
and strengthened by use, became legs of a
rudimentary kind, which by further use developed
a system of bones and muscles and nerves and
joints such as we have ourselves.</p>

<p>Spencer's account of the origin of quadrupeds
is that the earliest animals propagated by dividing
into two parts, and in some of these the division
was not perfectly made, and so the animal had
duplicated ends, each of which had legs, forming
finally the present quadruple arrangement.</p>

<p>Eyes originated from some animal having pigment
spots or freckles on the sides of its head,
which, turned to the sun, agreeably affected the
animal so that it acquired the habit of turning that
side of its head to the sun, and its posterity inherited
the same habit and passed it on to still
other generations. The pigment spot acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
sensitiveness by use and in time a nerve developed
which was the beginning of the eye. From this
incipient eye came the present wonderful combination
of lenses, nerves and muscles, all so accurately
adjusted that, of the sixteen possible adjustments
of each part, only once in a hundred
thousand times would they come together, as they
now are, by chance.</p>

<p>Land animals began thus, according to Evolution:
In a time of drought some water animals,
stranded by the receding waters, were obliged
thenceforth to adopt land manners and methods
of living. Although, strangely, the whale by the
same cause was forced to the water, for it was
once a land animal, but in a season of drought
was obliged to seek the water's edge for the scant
remaining herbage, and, finding the water agreeable,
remained there and its posterity also, and
finally, the teeth and legs no longer needed, became
decadent and abortive as we see them now.
Darwin inferred the history of the whale's marine
career from seeing a bear swimming in a pool and
catching insects with its wide-open mouth as it
so skimmed the water's surface.</p>

<p>The same drought produced another and wonderful
change, for it is to this that the giraffe
owes his long legs and neck. The herbage on the
lower branches withering up, he was obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
stretch his neck and legs to reach the higher
branches. This increased, as all such changes increased,
in his posterity, and finally after many
generations produced the present immense reaching
powers of the giraffe. So that the same
drought deprived the whale of his legs and conferred
them upon the giraffe.</p>

<p>The mere recital of these speculations will be
enough for all who have not surrendered their
judgment to the keeping of others. It seems
scarcely necessary to assure readers unacquainted
with the theory, that this is not exaggeration or
caricature. We have simply abbreviated, and
rendered into untechnical language, the accounts
of evolutionary writers given in all seriousness
and with high-sounding scientific terms. Any
such work will give many specimens of similar accounts.
Reply seems unnecessary, yet must be
made.</p>

<p>1. All this is pure speculation. Not a single
such change is known, or has been observed.</p>

<p>2. All is based on Natural Selection, which
evolutionists have themselves discarded; yet for
want of any other theory they are constantly
obliged to fall back upon it.</p>

<p>3. Such acquired traits are not transmitted, as
Prof. Thomson of Edinborough, tells us. Only
characteristics inherited, or congenital in the fertilized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
egg cell, are so transmitted. (<cite>Outlines of
Zoology</cite>, p. 66.) The "sports" such as the white
robins and crows occasionally seen, disappear as
individuals and do not propagate as distinct types.</p>

<p>Let us pause here to contemplate the spectacle
of a theory, which its own advocates admit is unproven,
and which has been opposed by some of
the greatest minds, a theory which has not a
single direct fact of evidence, and has no way of
accounting for the changes which it declares have
taken place; such a theory accepted as the basis
of every science, the foundation of a universal
philosophy, taught in educational institutions to
youth as if demonstrated, demanding immediate
and universal submission, undertaking to revise
Scripture, to revolutionize theology, and to prescribe
what we must do to be saved and to save
others! Surely it is safe to hesitate before such
demands.</p>

<p>We will not discount the great service done
humanity in the patient research in the realms of
nature by laborious students. All this should be
given weight. We also admit the value of a
theory as a means to the ascertaining of truth.
But we cannot consent that the vast interests affected
by Evolution shall be decided by "the balancings
of probabilities," or the mooted value of
a theory. This is no place for theories, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
must be held tentatively, if at all. This is a matter
which affects the belief and lives and hopes of
millions, their welfare here and hereafter. Religion
is too sacred to be made a shuttlecock tossed
about in the arena of intellectual amusement.</p>

<p>Sir J. William Dawson said of some writers and
their theories: "To launch a clever and startling
fallacy, which will float a week and stir up a hard
fight, seems as great a triumph as the discovery
of an important fact or law; and the honest student
is distracted with the multitude of doctrines
and hustled aside by the crowd of ambitious
groundlings." (<cite>Story of the Earth and Man</cite>,
313.)</p>

<p>Evolution has much to say for itself, but, as we
see, it is all of the nature of circumstantial evidence.
This seems to the non-scientific mind as
strange for anything called science, which we
have been accustomed to think means something
known or proven. We have been accustomed to
see cases thrown out of court when presenting no
evidence and to fare badly in general on mere
circumstantial evidence. However, as Evolution
is so persistent for a hearing, we must examine
what it has to advance for our consideration. Its
arguments are drawn from Geology, Classification,
Distribution of Plants and Animals, Morphology
and Embryology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE ARGUMENT FROM GEOLOGY.</h3>

<p>The argument from this science is that the
fossils appear in the strata of the earth in advancing
order, the simplest first, and more complex
afterwards. The assumption is that the higher
came from the lower, by a chain of infinitesimal
changes, through a long series of ages. Now the
facts are not as claimed. We will show this later.
But admitting that they are, the argument is
wanting.</p>

<p>1. All this is pure assumption. No such
changes are known in existing species to have
ever taken place, and the assumption that these
changes took place in geologic ages is wholly unwarranted.
If it cannot be predicated of the animals
we see and know, how can it be asserted of
a period millenniums ago?</p>

<p>2. Mere succession is not evolution. The
coming in orderly succession is evidence of some
plan but not necessarily of evolution. An intelligent
Creator would work in the same way, especially
if he had intelligent beings to instruct
thereby, at the time or afterwards.</p>

<p>3. Evolution in comparing the successive comings
of the rocky strata and the fossil creatures,
compares two kinds of things that cannot be made
analogous. Rocks are not produced by evolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the higher growing out of the lower, as is claimed
of species. That certain species appeared with the
lower rocks and strata, and higher orders with
later rocks and strata only proves of one, as of
the other, an advancing order of production but
tells nothing of the cause of either.</p>

<p>4. We are supported in these doubts as to the
value of Evolution's argument from Geology by
the fact, that many of the most eminent geologists
deny any proof of evolution in their chosen
science.</p>

<p>Sir Roderick Murchison said, "I know as much
of nature in her geologic ages as any living man,
and I fearlessly say that our geologic record does
not afford one syllable of evidence in support of
Darwin's theory." The great Swiss geologist,
Joachim Barrande states, "One cannot conceive
why in all rocks whatever and in all countries
upon the two continents, all relics of the intervening
types should have vanished....
The discordances are so numerous and pronounced,
that the composition of the real fauna
seems to have been calculated by design for contradicting
everything which the theories (of Evolution)
teach us respecting the first appearance
and primitive evolution of the forms of life upon
the earth." (Quoted by Winchell, in <cite>Doctrine of
Evolution</cite>, p. 142.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Prof. Conn, an evolutionist, admits the presence
of many facts disclosed by geology which
oppose the theory of Evolution. He says, "In the
earliest records geology discloses, we find not a
few generalized types but well differentiated
forms, nearly all the sub-kingdoms as they now
exist, five-sixths of our orders, nearly an equal
proportion of sub-orders, a great many families
and some of our present species. All this is
a surprise and an unexplained problem." Such
a result, he says, is not what Evolution would
lead us to expect. All the important classes of
animals made their appearance without warning.
(<cite>Evolution of To-day</cite>, pp. 6, 100, 103, 118.)</p>

<p>Haeckel writes, "We cannot shut our eyes to
the fact that various groups have from the time
of their first appearance, burst out into an exuberant
growth of modification of form, size and
members, with all possible, and one might almost
say, impossible shapes, and they have done this
within a comparatively short time, after which
they have died out not less rapidly." (<cite>Last Link</cite>,
p. 144.)</p>

<p>The testimony of geology, as adduced by
geologists and even by evolutionists, is that it
does not sustain the claims of Evolution. Species
existed in present form from the earliest times.
Geologic species came in suddenly and went out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
suddenly. Some of the simplest remain unchanged
through all earth's transformations to
the present time. (Dr. Robert Patterson, <cite>Errors
of Evolution</cite>, p. 221.) The great fossil cemeteries
show that the living creatures fell in serried ranks,
overtaken by cataclysms, in every act of life. Le
Conte tries to explain this by saying that there
were "paroxysmal" eras, but what the paroxysms
were, or whence they came, he does not say. The
whole testimony is against Evolution and reverts
to proof of the Bible story of Creation. Professor
Adam Sedgwick says: "At succeeding epochs,
new tribes of beings were called into existence,
not merely as the progeny of those that had appeared
before them, but as new and living proofs
of creative interference."</p>


<h3>THE ARGUMENT FROM CLASSIFICATION OF SPECIES.</h3>

<p>This is one of the strong points of Evolution.
It is claimed that plants and animals can be so
classified in an ascending order that it is evident
the higher came out of the lower. We object as
follows:</p>

<p>1. There is no classification agreed upon by
scientists. This comes largely from want of
agreement as to what a species is. Scientists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
differ widely and radically. Spencer presents a
review of all these schemes of classification and
ends by saying, "It is absurd to attempt a definite
scheme of relationship." His own plan of the
scheme he says is the figure of a "laurel bush
squashed flat by a descending plane." (<cite>Principles
of Biology</cite>, p. 389.) This agrees with his
statement as to the absurdity of such schemes.
Some arrange the whole in a continuous straight
line from the lowest up.</p>

<p>Darwin thought the whole came from half a
dozen germinal forms. Where these came from
he did not say. Dr. J. Clark Ridpath said, "The
eagle was always an eagle, the man always
man. Every species of living organism has I
believe come up by a like process from its own
primordial germ." (<cite>Arena</cite>, June, 1879.) Haeckel
insists that the theory demands but a single
primeval germ as the ancestor of all living things.
He presented a tree, showing twenty or more
stages between primeval protoplasm and man, but
this has been now rejected by evolutionists. Prof.
D. Kerfoot Schults represents the classification as
follows: "If all the animals that have ever existed
on the earth be represented by a tree, those now
existing on the earth will be represented by the
topmost twigs and leaves, and the extinct forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
will be represented by the main trunk and
branches." (<em>First Book on Organic Evolution</em>,
p. xiv.)</p>

<p>But the source of all, the primeval protoplasm,
is wanting. The missing primeval germ or germs
leaves the tree without a root, and Prof. Conn
tells that even the sub-kingdoms are not united
by fossils. Spencer admits that not a single
species has been traced to its source or its family
tree completed, and even the ancestors of our
living species are wanting.</p>

<p>Prof. Dana admitted as follows, "If ever the
links (upon which the doctrine of Evolution depends)
had an actual existence, their disappearance
without a trace left behind is altogether inexplicable."
Here then is a tree without root or
trunk or branches, and having only the tips of
outer twigs and leaves, in other words, a phantom
tree, a fit representation of the theory for which
it stands.</p>

<p>The present orders of plants and animals give
a strong argument against Evolution. It has
been seen that Succession is not Evolution. The
mere coming of animals in orderly succession
shows only plan, but the means of executing that
plan is not shown thereby. But further, while in
the geologic ages there was Succession, here in
our age is Simultaneousness of species, two very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
different and contradictory phenomena. Why has
Succession ceased? Why have not the higher
orders pushed the lower out, as in the geologic
ages, if Evolution was the cause? Yet here they
all exist quietly together as if they knew nothing
of Evolution or its requirements.</p>

<p>Nor have any such changes occurred in thousands
of years, as the mummied remains of cats
and crocodiles and ibises in Egypt show. Surely
4,000 years would show some evolution if there
had been such a thing; but it is not seen in all
the 4,000 years, or even in the more distant period
since primeval man existed, for we have the remains
of animals found with man in his early
history. Out of 98 species, 57 are the same as
we have to-day unchanged, and still others, as
the lingula, the same as in ages past. Thus Evolution's
trusted argument from Classification
utterly fails of demonstration.</p>


<h3>DISTRIBUTION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS.</h3>

<p>The distribution of plants and animals is another
favorite argument of this theory. Certain
animals are said to be found only in certain
regions, the bison only in North America, the
kangaroo only in Australia, the armadillo only in
Mexico. Evolution triumphantly asks, Were they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
created only in these places? We now simply remark
that difficulties as to Creation do not prove
Evolution. Evolution says the ancestors of these
came from other parts ages ago and by long isolation
and environment became what they are.</p>

<p>Facts again are against the theory. Huxley
himself says that in the neighborhood of Oxford
are animal remains like those of Australia; that
Britain was once connected with the continent,
and so these animals passed over. The same is
true he says of the isolated fauna of New Zealand
and South America. (Address in <em>Daily Post</em>,
March 27, 1871.)</p>

<p>This argument might be used against Evolution
as well as the previous arguments. Two islands
in the Pacific, only fifteen miles apart, have the
animals of Asia in one and of Australia in the
other. One of the Bermudas has lizards like those
of Africa and another like those of America. In
fact it is evident that animals and plants have
scattered widely.</p>


<h3>THE MORPHOLOGICAL ARGUMENT.</h3>

<p>The comparative study of plants and animals
presents another argument for Evolution. It is
found, for example, that there is a similarity of
plan in the fin of the fish, the wing of the bird,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the flipper of the whale, the leg of the animal and
the arm of the man. So also in a measure with
all other corresponding parts. This Evolution
says, shows that all these animals are genetically
connected and all came from the same ancestors.</p>

<p>Huxley himself replies to this argument in
these words, "No amount of purely morphological
evidence can suffice to prove that things came
into existence in one way rather than another."
(<em>Study of Zoology</em>, p. 86.) Another great scientist,
Prof. Quatrefages, professor of anthropology
in the Museum of Natural Sciences, Paris,
writes on this as follows: "Without leaving
domain of facts, and only judging from what we
know, we can say, that morphology itself justifies
the conclusion that one species has never produced
another by derivation." Prof. Conn admits, after
going through the whole subject with the latest
facts, that unless some further explanation can be
found, homology does not prove descent. (<cite>Evolution
of To-day</cite>, p. 76.)</p>

<p>This resemblance of parts is just what we
should expect in things originating from one intelligent
operator, whether Creator or manufacturer.
It is found in every factory. The wheel is
the same in the wheelbarrow, the cart, carriage
and locomotive. In fact, uniformity of plan
proves unity in the cause, and not the diversity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of chance causes claimed by Evolution. If Evolution
were true, there would be as much diversity
among organs as there is among the forms
of organs. If the operation of chance conditions
has resulted in radical changes in the forms of
organs, why then is there not this similar diversity
among the organs themselves? Evolution has no
reply. Creation has such reply; God is one and
his plan one. Why should not the forms of all
these things be alike, seeing they are to live in the
same climates, eat the same food and propagate
in the same manner?</p>

<p>The rudimentary, abortive and discarded parts
found in some animals form one of the strongest
arguments Evolution advances. The favorite instance
it presents is found in the horse. The
horse walks on one toe and has splints further up
the leg, which they tell us are the remains of the
other toes, and the callosities on the leg are the
remains of thumbs. The remains have been found
of an animal as large as a dog which resembles
the horse and has two toes, and another older
animal, as large as a fox, which has four toes.
Putting these side by side, Evolution calls them all
horses, and says the one-toed animal came from
the two-toed, and he from the four-toed, and that
this proves the evolution of the horse from the
Eohippus (Old Horse) as it is called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Bearing in mind that this conclusion is pure
assumption, and only inference at best, let us remark
that it violates the primal law of evolution
laid down by Spencer, that of evolution from the
simple to the complex. It should have shown
first the one-toed horse, then his development
into a two-toed animal, and so on up to a horse
having five toes. This would be evolution. As it
is, we see the opposite of evolution, degradation,
which often occurs in nature, and we see few if
any instances of any subsequent restoration to
primal conditions.</p>

<p>2. Besides all this, that most necessary thing to
a good horse, a pedigree, is wanting. The connecting
links are all missing in his ancestral tree.
For the ancestors of that first of horses are unknown.
But he is not alone in this, for even his
owner has the same sad want of proven descent,
as we will see later. Just how the horse lost his
appendages, and why he dropped toe after toe
in this extraordinary manner the story leaves untold.</p>

<p>3. But another great objection exists. It takes
time to breed horses. It required all of the Tertiary
period to produce the one-toed animal from
the four-toed ancestor and much longer time
was required to develop him from a totally different
animal, where more than a mere question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of toes comes in. For we have to face the difficulty,
and the time necessary, to develop a good
horse, say from an alligator, and the still greater
task of producing him from an animal without
toes at all, or even legs, or anything to hang legs
on, and simply a bag of jelly-like substance, which
the evolutionist assures us was the ancestor of all
horses and their riders. If it appears to the reader
that life is too short for such business we can say
the geologist agrees with him, for he tells us the
age of the old earth itself was not one tenth long
enough to produce Evolution's horses, and still
less their riders.</p>

<p>Another instance of Evolution's proofs is the
swim-bladder of fishes. This Evolution sometimes
states is an incipient lung, and that the fish
learned in a drought to breathe air. Sometimes,
as the need of the theory demands, the swim-bladder
is claimed as the relic of a discarded lung.
These however are two different and opposing
claims. Either as a prophecy or a relic the swim-bladder
is fatal to the claims of Evolution. If it
is an incipient lung, then here is intention, which
Evolution rejects. If a relic, here is retrogression,
the opposite of evolution. The abortive organ is
one of the difficulties of the theory which Darwin
admitted, and Prof. Conn tells us, is not yet
answered. Prof. Huxley said, "Either these rudiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
are of no use to the animal, in which case
they ought to have disappeared, or they are of
some use to the animal, in which case they are
arguments for teleology." (<cite>Darwinism</cite>, p. 151.)</p>


<h3>THE ARGUMENT FROM EMBRYOLOGY.</h3>

<p>Evolution derives its greatest argument from
the study of the embryo. It makes three claims.
First, that the germ of everything, plant and animal,
is the same, neither chemical analysis nor the
microscope showing any difference. If therefore,
such vast variety could come from origins so
alike, why could not all we see come from a similar
origin, the primitive animal, which was also
such a simple cell? Second, in the growth of the
embryo it recapitulates the ancestral history of
that particular organism. Third, all this when
compared with the geologic record, and the present
orders of living things as classified, presents
the full succession of the forms of life, the one
supplying what the other lacks.</p>

<p>These claims must be examined separately.</p>

<p>1. The claim that the germs of all living things
are alike is not true. The resemblance is only
superficial. Protoplasm, of which the germ is
composed, differs and is not homogeneous material.
That which builds the muscles is one kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and that which builds brain and nerves is entirely
different. Prof. Clodd tells us it is not a
chemical compound but a mechanism. Nor could
the germs be alike. For the plant breathes carbon,
the animal oxygen. The one oxidizes, the
other deoxidizes. There are still greater and
deeper differences.</p>

<p>Tyndall says, "Under the most homogeneous
material, there lie structural energies of such complexity,
that we must question whether we have
the mental elements with which to grapple with
them.... The most trained and disciplined
imagination retires in bewilderment from the
problem. In that realm, inaccessible to everything
but mind, the wonders of Creation are
wrought out.... Here is determined the
germ and afterwards the complete organization."
(<cite>Fragments of Science</cite>, p. 153.) So that these
cells or germs, which appear so alike, contain each
in itself the entire plan and life of the coming
creature, to the color of a feather, the trick of a
hunting dog and the smile and dimples of a child.</p>

<p>2. The second claim that the course of each
embryo traverses its ancestral history, is not
nearly so vociferously made as some years ago.
Prof. A. Agassiz writes, "Anything beyond a general
parallelism is hopeless." Prof. Conn admits
"Embryology alone is not a safe guide, and only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
when verified by the fossils can it be relied upon.
It seldom gives a true history.... The
parallel is largely a delusion.... It often
gives a false history." (<cite>Evolution of To-day</cite>, pp.
125, 134, 137, 150.) Prof. Thomson writes, "Recapitulation
is due to no dead hands of the past,
but to physiological conditions which we are unable
to discover." (<cite>Outline of Zoology</cite>, p. 63.)
He also says that the young mammal was never
like a worm, a fish, or reptile. It was at the most
like the young of these in their various stages. So
far from the course of all being alike, Baer says
he can tell the difference between the embryo of
the common fowl and duck on the second day.
(<cite>Principles of Biology</cite>, p. 1.) So far as this claim
holds good, it forms an argument against evolution.
For here is a goal or ideal to which all
things strive. This is intention, and plan and
purpose, all of which is opposed to the main idea
of Evolution. It is in line with Creation.</p>

<p>3. The culminating argument for Evolution is
given by arranging in ascending classification the
geologic orders of life (which we have seen do
not appear as Evolution demands), and placing
alongside of these the classification of present
animals (which we have seen is not agreed upon,
and is as diverse as the writers themselves), and
then laying alongside of these two artificial arrangements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the embryonic recital (which is now
doubted and is often false to the past history),
and triumphantly pointing to the three-fold combination.
The gaps geology shows are thus filled
by present forms and what both lack, by the embryonic
recital.</p>

<p>Here are compared three things which radically
differ. The geologic record shows progress from
lower to higher, although not that complete nor
unvarying record necessary to the theory,
while the present orders of life exist simultaneously.
Both show the existence of separate things
having no individual connection. The embryo is
a single individual, designed from its conception
on a predetermined plan, animated by internal
forces, and limited to a certain end and life. It
is as Dawson says, a "closed series." The worlds
of living and fossil creatures consist of myriads
of individuals, under many widely different conditions,
and aimed at widely different ends and
lives. The two are contradictory for the uses of
Evolution.</p>

<p>What we do see in these three facts are three
marks of personal intelligence. In embryonic
growth we see the plan of production. In the
coming of the fossil creatures we see the progress
of the plan in historical appearance. In the present
display of nature we see the ultimate purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of the whole. It all forms one great consistent
plan and bears all the marks of personal and
creative work.</p>

<p>So that summing up the argument from comparison
of the three facts, the geologic order, the
present classification, and the embryonic growth,
we find in the first absolute separation of species,
in the second no genetic connection as already
shown under that argument, and in the third different
phenomena having no points in common
with the other two. The whole argument then
fails of conclusion and reverts as the former do,
to proof against Evolution.</p>


<h3>FACTS OPPOSING EVOLUTION OF SPECIES.</h3>

<p>A theory to be proven must meet the facts and
account for them. The theory in question fails
lamentably in this. There are countless facts not
only unaccounted for but diametrically opposed
to it and antagonizing it. We cite some of these:</p>

<p>1. <em>Degeneration in nature.</em> Nature shows a constant
tendency downward. Prof. E. D. Cope, an
eminent evolutionist, writes: "The retrogradation
in nature is as well or nearly as well established
as evolution." The wild varieties of plants and
animals are far inferior to the cultivated kinds.
The older species are far superior to the present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
The saber-toothed tiger is far superior to the
present animal. So also is the Mammoth as compared
with the elephant. Plants show degeneration
in colors. The order of superiority is from
yellow, the lowest, to white, pink, red, purple and
blue, the highest. When they drop from blue to
yellow, it is degeneration. Some now having
green flowers once had colored blossoms. Progress
is not seen to be upward in the flowers. So
also parasitism is degeneration both in plants and
animals. The course of nature is not, as it has
not been, constant development upward. The
scripture statement "The whole creation groaneth
and travaileth in pain," describes accurately
the condition of nature (<em>Ro.</em> 8:22.)</p>

<p>2. <em>Continued unchanged species for ages.</em> The
crustacea, for example in Lake Tanganyika,
Africa, remain as the receding ocean left them
ages ago.</p>

<p>3. <em>Species instead of increasing in number have
decreased.</em> There were 500 species of trilobites.
They have all disappeared. There were 900 species
of ammonites; all are gone. Of the 450 species
of nautilus, only three remain. Indeed whole
families have become obliterated. All this is antagonistic
to Evolution.</p>

<p>4. <em>Species continue the same under the most
diverse environments.</em> Environment is claimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
as a cause of the changes demanded by Evolution.
But the same species exist in the most diverse
regions, e. g., mosquitoes, whales and oaks.</p>

<p>5. <em>Adaptation of one species to another.</em> Darwin
says that a single case of the adaptation of
one species to another would be fatal to his theory.
Yet he himself gives the data for hundreds
of such adaptations. He adduces the fact that a
hundred head of red clover produced 2,700 seeds.
A similar number protected from insects produced
none. The fertilization of plants by insects
is well known. The Smyrna fig is said to
owe its value to its fertilization by the piercing of
an insect. Some of these insects have been introduced
into California for that purpose. There
is an orchid which can be fertilized only by an
insect falling into a cup of liquid which the flower
has, and escaping through a side opening in which
it touches the pollen.</p>

<p>Dr. Andrew Wilson writes: The colors of
flowers&mdash;nay, even the little splashes of a hue or
tint seen on a petal&mdash;are intended to attract insects
that they may carry off the fertilizing dust,
or pollen, to other flowers. It is to this end also
that your flowers are many of them sweet-scented.
The perfume is another kind of invitation to the
insect world. The honey they secrete forms a
third attraction&mdash;the most practical of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <em>Complex adjustments of nature.</em> Evolution
in vain attempts to account for the wonderful
complex adjustments we see in nature, such as
the mimicry of animals and plants; the walking
stick so closely resembles a twig that it deceives
the closest observer. The withered leaf butterfly,
with spots and wrinkles, is exactly like the thing
it imitates. This is true also of the leaf butterfly
and of another which exactly resembles a bird's
dropping. Evolution cannot account for the ventriloquism
of insects, such as the cricket and tree
toad; the battery of the electric eel; the beauty of
insects and fish and shells and birds and flowers,
especially the harmony of their colors. Edible insects
are plainly colored, the poisonous kinds
highly colored. Some butterflies have "scare-heads"
on their wings, exactly resembling an
owl's head, and other insects have similar frightful
appearances which they thrust out when attacked.
All this tells of design and interest and
often has the appearance of humor in the creation
of these numerous creatures.</p>

<p>7. <em>The mathematical adjustments of nature are
as exact as the multiplication table.</em> Illustrations
of this are the accuracy of the orbits of the heavenly
bodies and the law of gravitation. The
growth of the cell proceeds on geometrical progression
in the division of parts into 2, 4, 8, 16,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
etc. The climbing plants form their coils with
mathematical accuracy and proportion. The proportions
in which chemicals will mix is mathematically
fixed.</p>

<p>Prof. Tyndall thus calls our attention to crystallization:
"By permitting alum to crystallize in
this slow way we obtain these perfect octahedrons;
by allowing carbonate of lime to crystallize, nature
produces these beautiful rhomboids; when silica
crystallizes we have formed the hexagonal prisms
capped at the end by pyramids; by allowing saltpeter
to crystallize, we have these prismatic
masses, and when carbon crystallizes we have the
diamond." (<cite>Fragments of Science</cite>, p. 357.)
"Looking at it mentally we see the molecules
[of sulphate of soda] like disciplined squadrons
under a governing eye, arranging themselves into
battalions, gathering around distinct centers and
forming themselves into distinct solid masses,
which after a time assume the visible shape of the
crystal now held in my hand. Here then is an
architect at work, who makes no chips nor din,
and who is now building the particles into crystals
similar in shape to these beautiful masses we
see upon the table." (<cite>Belfast Address.</cite>)</p>

<p>8. <em>The structure of living things shows the
true principles of architecture.</em> A Mr. McLaughlin,
a noted Scotch mathematician, tried by mathematical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
calculation to ascertain the shape of a
building which would contain the most room with
least material and yet embody the greatest architectural
strength in its retaining walls. After
many laborious calculations, he found after he
had arrived at a conclusion that the honey bee
had long before given the same plan of structure
in its cell. The human skull is a true dome, and
the spinal column a true pillar. The ribs of the
ship are copied from the fish, the yacht from the
duck, and its deep fin from the fish.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Evolution pretends to account for every one
of these facts by chance changes, extending
through countless ages as has already been shown
in its amazing account of the origin of legs, eyes,
backbones and other members. Surely this is an
appeal to credulity! The faith of the Christian
is sometimes taxed but what shall we say of the
faith of the evolutionist? Which is more credible,
the simple account of miraculous creation or
this long, involved and absolutely unseen and unknown
process?</p>

<p>9. <em>The age of the earth.</em> Prof. George Frederick
Wright, the geologist, tells us that geologic
time is not one-hundredth part as long as it was
supposed to be fifty years ago, and the popular
writers who glibly talk of the antiquity of man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
are behind the times and ignorant of the new light
which as a flood has come from geology.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Summing up the case, Prof. Francis M. Balfour
tells us: "All these facts that fall under our
observation contradict the crude ideas of those so-called
naturalists, who state that one species can
be transmitted into another in the course of generations."
So also Sir David Brewster declares:
"We have absolute proof of the immutability of
species, whether we search for it in historic or
geologic times."</p>

<p>Dr. Etheridge, the famous English authority on
fossils, says: "Nine-tenths of the talk of evolutionists
is sheer nonsense, not founded on observation
and wholly unsupported by fact. Men
adopt a theory and then strain their facts to support
it. I read all their books, but they make no
impression on my belief in the stability of species.
Some men are ready to regard you as a fool if
you do not go with them in all their vagaries, but
this museum is full of proofs of the utter falsity
of their views."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>THE EVOLUTION OF MAN.</h3>


<p>The central point in the whole theory is the
descent of man from the brute. It is this which,
as stated, gives it importance to the Christian.
But for this, the hypothesis would be but a curious
scientific theory. It is a matter of comparatively
minor interest how the universe or the
various species came. It is only because these
theories are used to assert the animal origin of
man that they are dealt with here.</p>

<p>It is in this claim as to the origin of man that
all the various theories of Evolution agree, however
they may vary in other matters, and, as this
is the vital point, these theories are considered
as one in this discussion. This is a question merely
of fact. Did or did not man descend from the
brute or was he specially and divinely created?
This is the question in a nut-shell. The two accounts
are as follows placed side by side. Darwin's
account is accepted substantially by all evolutionists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE BIBLE ACCOUNT.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>(Gen. i:26, 27; ii:7; v:1, 2.)</p></blockquote>

<p>"And God said, Let us
make man in our image,
after our likeness.... And
God created man in his
own image, in the image of
God created he him; male
and female created he
them.... And the Lord
God formed man of the
dust of the ground and
breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life and man
became a living soul....
In the day that God created
man, in the likeness of
God made he him:
male and female created
he them; and blessed them
and called their name
Adam."</p>


<h3>EVOLUTION'S ACCOUNT.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>(From Darwin's Descent of
Man, ii, 372.)</p></blockquote>

<p>"Man is descended from
a hairy quadruped, furnished
with a tail and pointed
ears, probably arborial
in its habits and an inhabitant
of the Old World.
This creature, if its whole
structure had been examined
by a naturalist, would
have been classed among
the Quadrumana, as surely
as would the common and
still more ancient progenitor
of the Old and New
World monkeys. The
Quadrumana and all the
higher mammals are probably
derived from an
ancient marsupial animal,
and this through a long
line of diversified forms,
either from some reptile-like,
or some amphibian-like
creature, and this
again from some fish-like
animal. In the dim obscurity
of the past, we can see
that the early progenitor
of the Vertebrata must
have been an aquatic
animal, provided with
branchia, with the two
sexes united in the same
individual."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bible account is circumstantial, with mention
of places and rivers of undoubted historical
character. It is accepted by subsequent Scripture
writers and made the basis of their historical and
spiritual teachings. The evolutionary account is
lacking in all of this. There are no exact data
nor any attempt to give any. No description save
an imaginary one is ever given. As no one was
there to see, the whole is fanciful.</p>

<p>The two accounts are utterly irreconcilable.
Whatever the Scripture account means it does not
mean Evolution, and literary justice demands that
we do not impose upon a writer a meaning he
did not intend or give.</p>

<p>Prof. Pfliederer writes, "There is only one
choice. When we say Evolution we definitely
deny Creation. When we say Creation we definitely
deny Evolution." Prof. James Sully says,
"The doctrine of Evolution is directly antagonistic
to that of Creation." (<cite>Bible Student</cite>, July,
1901, quoted by Prof. Warfield.)</p>

<p>How anyone can accept both accounts passes
all understanding. The late Dr. John Henry Barrows,
president of Oberlin University, tells of
meeting a Hindu boy in his visit to India, who
had attended the mission schools and learned
there the shape and situation of the earth. He
had of course previously been taught the Hindu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
cosmogony that the earth was surrounded by salt
water and that by a circle of earth and that by
successive circles of buttermilk, sweet cane juice,
and other "soft drinks" with intervening circles
of land. Dr. Barrows asked the boy which belief
he would hereafter hold. He replied that he
would believe both. This might be possible to
the Hindu boy, but it surpasses all previous intellectual
feats that any intelligent person can accept
both the Bible account and Darwin's account
of the creation of man.</p>

<p>We will review the arguments for and against
the evolutionary account of the origin of man
from the following spheres and subjects:</p>

<p>1. The Argument from the Evolution of Species.
2. From Similarity of Structure in Animals
and Man. 3. Rudimentary Organs in Man.
4. Human Characteristics in Animals. 5. History
of the Evolution of Man from the Brute.
6. The "Missing Link." 7. The Brain. 8. Man's
Mind and Consciousness. 9. Language. 10.
Pre-historic Man. 11. Antiquity of Man. 12.
Savage Races. 13. History of Mankind. 14. Religion.
15. Ethics. 16. Christian Experience.
17. Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>


<h4>1. ARGUMENT FROM THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.</h4>

<p>On this argument rests the theory of man's animal
origin. But for the desire to prove that such
is man's origin, the argument would never have
been conceived. We introduce it here again to
call special attention to this fact. We have seen
that there is decided difference of opinion on this
theory; that many object to it; that there is not
a single case of such origin of species known;
that there is no law or force or cause agreed upon
or known by which such origin of species could
take place; that there are countless objections and
facts against it; that its arguments are confessedly
insufficient; and they are at best but inferences
and only "the balancing of probabilities."</p>

<p>If therefore the proofs of the Origin of Species
are wanting the whole theory of Evolution
falls in ruins to the ground. There would seem
no need to proceed further. Yet Evolution lightly
steps over the ruins of its previous claims and
proceeds to further assertions. Some of the greatest
of the exact scientists stop here. Prof. Dana,
the great geologist, says: "Man's origin has thus
far no sufficient explanation from science. The
abruptness of transition from preceding forms is
most extraordinary and especially because it occurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
so near the present time." (<cite>Elements of
Geology.</cite>)</p>

<p>Prof. Virchow, the most eminent pathologist
of Europe, wrote as follows: "There always exists
a sharp line of demarcation between man and
the ape. We cannot pronounce it proved by
science that man descends from the ape, or from
any other animal. Whoever calls to mind the
lamentable failure of all attempts made very recently
to discover a decided support for the '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">generatio
aequivoc</i>' in the lower forms of transition
from the inorganic to the organic world will feel
it doubly serious to demand that this theory, so
utterly discredited, should be in any form accepted
as the basis of our views of life."</p>

<p>Many more such expressions might be quoted
from eminent scientists to the same effect. But
as we will use these under the respective heads of
the foregoing order of argument, we pass on here
to the arguments as stated.</p>


<h4>2. SIMILARITY OF STRUCTURE IN ANIMALS AND
MAN.</h4>

<p>It is well known that the internal and external
form of man is like that of the lower animals.
This, Evolution claims, is an argument for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
genetic connection. The same argument would
prove that a locomotive was born from a stage
coach, and that from a cart, and that from a
wheelbarrow. Similarity of structure proves only
uniformity of design. An intelligent maker of
any nature would so operate, and man himself so
manufactures now. Why should not God make
man on the model of the lower animals, seeing
he is to live in the same world, under the same
conditions, eat the same food and propagate in
the same way? There is no reason for departure
from a form which has proved useful and appropriate.
All the parts in the human form have
been thus tested in the lower forms and found
right for their purpose and are now, as we would
expect, applied to man. Man is the climax of all.
All is for his use in the lower worlds of plants
and animals; then why not use their frame and
inner organs also? The mechanic uses the same
appliance such as the wheel in his most complex
construction as well as in the simplest engine.</p>

<p>But there are parts in the human frame not
found in the lower orders. Wallace, one of the
greatest evolutionists, says the soft human skin
cannot be accounted for by natural causes, nor
the valves in the human veins which are in different
position from those of the brute, nor the human
foot nor larynx, nor the human voice, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the female voice, nor the absence of hair on
the body, nor why man is short armed and long
legged, while his ape-man ancestor is the reverse.
Many more such problems vex the evolutionist.
Creation accounts for all this, and does so by one
simple, sweeping argument in place of Evolution's
complex and bewildering maze of speculations.</p>

<p>Ruskin teaches us in this extract that God
works by law and does not deviate therefrom
even where it seems to us that He might have
wrought differently: "But God shows us in Himself,
strange as it may seem, not only authoritative
perfection, but even the perfection of obedience,
an obedience to his own laws; and in the
cumbrous movement of those unwieldiest of His
creatures, we are reminded, even in His divine essence,
of that attribute of uprightness in the human
creature, 'that sweareth to his own hurt and
changeth not.'" (<em>Seven Lamps of Architecture</em>,
II., p. 78.)</p>


<h4>3. RUDIMENTARY ORGANS IN MAN.</h4>

<p>Evolution points to certain features in man
which it claims came from his brute ancestry, such
as the long hairs in the eyebrow, which they say
came from the ape-man, the tips of the ear, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the hair on the forearm, which slants from the
hand to the elbow. The whole outside ear is also
claimed as a relic from that brute and is unnecessary
for hearing. So also of the five toes when
a solid foot would have been better, although most
of us think not. They also point to some evidences
of a tail which they say was rubbed off when the
ape-man learned to sit down. This, however,
many apes do now with no signs of decreasing
tails. Many internal members and organs are
pointed to, which are too numerous here to mention.
One instance is as good as the whole catalogue,
and one reply also.</p>

<p>All this proves too much for the theory. Here
is the loss of useful organs and the survival of
others not needed. This is not evolution, at least
not the kind we have been asked to build our
hopes upon for progress. Further, these so-called
"relics of the brute" are counted as having no use
save to support Evolution. The "gill-slits" in
the neck of the human embryo are the favorite
instance of this kind of fact. Haeckel and, after
him others, picture the forms of fish, dog and
man in embryonic state, and say in triumph, There
is proof of the descent of the man from the dog
and of him from the fish; and this resemblance
has survived to tell the tale, there being no other
use for it. But this is not the only feature that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
"survives." Heads and mouths and eyes also
"survive." Why are these not pointed to as
proofs of descent? Because we can see use for
them, while there appears to be no use for the
"gill-slits" except to prove Evolution. If we could
see some use in the "gill-slits" in the neck of the
embryo, the argument of Evolution would fall to
the ground. Evolution's argument from the gill-slits
and all other "relics of the brute" rests therefore
on ignorance, a very unsafe foundation for
a scientific theory, for knowledge is constantly increasing,
especially of the human frame, and there
is not the slightest doubt, reasoning from analogy
and past experience, that there is use for these
peculiar embryonic features.</p>

<p>We repeat the argument of Huxley as to these
rudimentary parts: "Either these rudiments are
of no use, in which case they should have disappeared;
or they are of use, in which case they are
arguments for teleology." (<em>Darwinism and Design</em>,
p. 151.)</p>

<p>Evidences of this nature are of that kind called
circumstantial, and in law are least relied upon,
for on such evidence some innocent men have
been hung. Shall we condemn the whole race to
a bestial origin on the same evidence? All arguments
founded on such facts are weak, puerile
and unworthy of scientists. No wonder that Prof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Paulsen said Haeckel's speculations are "a disgrace
to the philosophy of Germany." Shall we
suspend a philosophy of the universe upon a few
long hairs? Shall we allow the guess as to the
origin of the tip of the outer ear to revolutionize
theology? Shall we risk our eternal destiny on
the supposed uselessness of the so-called "gill-slits"
in premature puppies? Yet this is the
demand of Evolution reduced to plain English.</p>


<h4>4. HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS IN ANIMALS.</h4>

<p>The human characteristics found in animals
form an argument for Evolution. We find the animals
have memory, love, hatred, jealousy; that
they can think and plan, use means and weapons,
admire things of beauty, and some have sports.
All of this, so Evolution claims, points to genetic
connection with man. But all this only shows uniformity
in the inner as in the outer being. There
is as much reason for the one as for the other.
Life is the same wherever we find it. The forces
which operate in the rain drop are the same as in
the universe of boundless space. The intellectual
nature of man is the same as that of angels who
have no genetic connection with us. Even devils
are the same in the intellectual nature as God
himself. Mind is the same thing wherever it exists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
To say therefore that because animals have
certain characteristics like those of man, they are
the ancestors of man, is a leap to a conclusion entirely
unwarranted by either facts or logic. Yet
it is on such conclusions that Evolution rests.
Creation would proceed on the same comprehensive
plan, and we have seen that man does also.
He applies his forces as he does his materials to
the most varied uses.</p>

<p>Nor has any instance of the development of a
brute or his faculties to any approach to man's
faculties ever been known. The highest animal is
still immeasurably below the lowest and most
bestial man, not only in the grade of the faculties
that they have in common, but in others which
the animal does not possess and cannot acquire.
There is a great gulf fixed which they do not pass
over&mdash;as our next section will show.</p>


<h4>5. HISTORY FROM THE BRUTE TO THE MAN.</h4>

<p>Many have essayed the relation of the story
of the change from the brute to the man. In
doing so, some have covered themselves with
ridicule, yet the attempts continue to be made
as do others to produce perpetual motion.
To bridge this chasm is necessary in order to
sustain Evolution, for this is the heart of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
question. It is said that a famous professor of
history abandoned his chair because of the uncertainty
of the facts of history. One would expect
that the attempt to relate what happened before
man had any history, or even existed, would be
even more hazardous. Yet we are given the account
with such assurance as sometimes to deceive
the very elect&mdash;who abandon their Bibles.
Haeckel's attempt was the most impressive, and
swept all before it, for a year or two. He presented
a many-branched tree, whose roots were
protoplasm, its trunk protozoa, its successive
branches sponges, fish, reptiles, birds, marsupials,
monkeys, apes, man-apes, and the topmost
branches, man. Of the twenty-one stages, half
have been proved to be "wrong" by evolutionists
and the rest are "doubtful."</p>

<p>The home of the primeval man, or ascending-ape,
whichever it or he was, is one of the difficult
facts to settle. Haeckel locates it at the bottom
of the Indian ocean. He can thus defy disproof.
Another says it was in the tropics somewhere.
This is also a safe assertion. The difficulty is that
the remains of the pre-historic man are found in
the northern regions, while the ancestor animal
was a denizen of the tropics. So another declares
that the original home was in the northern regions,
to which a pair of wild animals of the ancestor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
kind were driven by something or somebody,
and their retreat cut off, and so they were
forced to the life in caves and adopted the habits
we find among cave dwellers.</p>

<p>But although our ancestor cannot be located
we are told just who and what he was. Thus
Prof. Edward Clodd, an authoritative evolutionist,
tells us in his book, "The Making of a Man,"
as follows: "Whichever among the arboreal
creatures possessed any favorable variation, however
slight, of brain or sense organ, would secure
an advantage over less favored rivals in the struggle
for food and mates and elbow room. The
qualities which gave them success would be transmitted
to their offspring. The distance in one
generation would be increased in the next; brain
power conquering brute force and skill outwitting
strength. While some for awhile remained arboreal
in their habits, never moving easily on the
ground, although making some approach to upright
motion, as seen in the shambling gait of the
manlike apes, others developed a way of walking
on their hind legs, which entirely set free the fore
limbs as organs of handling and throwing. Whatever
were the conditions which permitted this, the
advantage which it gives is obvious. It was the
making of a man." (p. 126.)</p>

<p>It seems difficult, indeed unfair, to take this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
seriously. We must assure the reader that
the author of this description shows no intention
of humor either here or elsewhere in his
work, or indeed any consciousness of it. All is
given in perfect sobriety. We must therefore
accept it as a profound scientific deliverance of
the most authoritative kind and deal with it accordingly,
and believe that walking on the hind
legs and throwing things with the fore limbs was
"the making of a man." How easily men are
made!</p>

<p>1. This argument rests on the theory of Natural
Selection now discarded by most evolutionists.</p>

<p>2. Apes have done all he here claims and far
more. The chimpanzee has been taught to sit at
a table, to drink out of cups, to eat with a knife
and fork, to wipe his mouth with a napkin and
use a toothpick, but has got no further in the ways
of good society, and as to increase of cranial development,
has obtained none save as the effects of
undue potations have produced an enlarged feeling.</p>

<p>3. The whole account is purely imaginary as
no professor of Evolution was there to observe
the facts. It is in short an intrusion into the
realm of fiction, which clearly belongs to Mr.
Kipling in his wonderful jungle stories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Again in his book on "Man and His Ancestor,"
(p. 67.) Prof. Morris gives us a full description
of this unseen and purely hypothetical ancestor as
follows: "It was probably much smaller than
existing man, little if any more than four feet in
height, and not more than half the weight of man.
Its body was covered, though not profusely, with
hair; the hair of the head being woolly or frizzly
in texture and the face provided with a beard.
The face was not jet black, like a typical African,
but of a dull brown color; the hair being somewhat
similar in color. The arms were long and
lank, the back being much curved, the chest flat
and narrow, the abdomen protruding, the legs
rather short and bowed, the walk a waddling motion
somewhat like that of the gibbon. It had
deep set eyes, greatly protruding mouth with gaping
lips, huge ears and general "ape-like aspect."
Prof. John Fiske thought it was much more than
a million years since man diverged from the
brute. During an active geologic age before the
cave-man appeared on the scene, "a being erect
upon two legs and having the outward resemblance
of a man wandered hither and thither
upon the face of the earth." (<em>Destiny of Man</em>,
p. 55.)</p>

<p>We read all this with astonishment that anyone
could penetrate the dim vista of millions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
years ago and transcribe such a detailed and circumstantial
account of what then existed. It reads
like a picture from life. Yet not only was the
writer not there, but no one else was present, for
this was the father of us all, according to Evolution.</p>

<p>We are told that, given time enough, all this
series of changes from the primeval cell to the
modern philosopher or scientist is possible. But
time for this is limited by the age of the earth.
For Lord Kelvin has stated that only a few million
years are possible on any calculation and this
would all be needed for the change from ape to
man to say nothing of the interminable ages necessary
for the change from the protozoa to the
fish and then to land animals and so on to mammals
and up to the ape.</p>

<p>The after life of the ape-man is described with
the same circumstantiality as the coming to manhood's
estate. Dr. Robert Patterson combines the
various features of Evolution's description and
this creature's history in the following extract:
"It is a fearful and wonderful picture they give
us of the origin of marriage from the battles of
baboons, of the rights of property established by
terrible fights for groves of good chestnuts, of
the beginning of morals from the instincts of
brutes, and of the dawnings of religion, or rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of superstition, from the dreams of these animals;
the result of the whole being that civilization and
society and law and order and religion are all simply
the evolution of the instincts of the brutes
and that there is no necessity for the invoking
any supernatural interference to produce them."
(<em>Fables of Infidelity.</em>)</p>

<p>It is here we meet the "theistic" account of
the origin of man. It was to this creature we are
told God imparted a soul or spirit supernaturally.
For this strange creature was the Adam of theistic
Evolution. Eve they say nothing about. Nor
are we told how or when the soul was imparted,
whether in a single animal, a pair, or a herd;
whether awake or asleep. Nor are we told what
they did next, or how the soul-ape got along with
the rest of the species. Nor are we told what particular
state, or act, or habit, entitled him to the
new nature he received. It seems as if the ability
to "stand on the hind legs and throw things with
the fore limbs," which Prof. Clodd tells us was
the "making of a man," scarcely entitled him to
such a divine inheritance as an immortal soul.</p>

<p>This also was the Adam who fell according to
the theistic evolutionist, though how such a creature
could "fall" seems difficult to conceive. It
was this thing whose sin, Paul tells us, brought
death on the whole race. It was this who is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
type of Christ who is "the Second Adam." Out
and out Evolution has but a fraction of the difficulties,
either physical or spiritual, to face that
this make-shift compromise "theistic" theory has
before it. It is not surprising that the thorough-going
evolutionist rejects this strange compound
of fiction and theology.</p>

<p>We appeal to the common, every-day man of
fair judgment: Which takes more faith, or if
preferred, credulity, the accepting of that strange,
complex, unauthenticated account of man's origin
or the simple and, with an omnipotent God in
mind, entirely possible account of the Bible?
"The Lord God formed man of the dust of the
ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath
of life: and man became a living soul." Which
is the more noble, the more satisfying to our desires
for a high and divine origin as well as high
and divine destiny?</p>


<h4>6. THE MISSING LINK.</h4>

<p>The Missing Link is the great desideratum of
Evolution, for the evolutionist indignantly disclaims
the present apes or monkey as ancestors.
He tells us the connecting link was a creature superior
to these. But of which he is unable to show
any specimen. It is purely mythical. We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the remains of millions of animals reaching
through all the ages and why is this particular
specimen wanting?</p>

<p>Dr. Rudolph Virchow, the great discoverer of
the germ theory, has for thirty years, according
to Haeckel, "opposed the theory of man's descent
from the brute." (<em>Last Link</em>, p. 27.) He himself
says: "The intermediate form is unimaginable
save in a dream.... We cannot teach or
consent that it is an achievement that man has descended
from the ape or other animal." (<em>Homiletic
Review</em>, January, 1901.)</p>

<p>Dr. Friedrich Pfaff, professor of natural
sciences in the University of Erlangen, writes on
the question as follows: "Nowhere in the older
deposits is an ape that approximates more closely
to man, or man that approximates more closely
to an ape, or perhaps a man at all. The same gulf
which is found to-day between man and the ape
goes back with undiminished breadth and depth
to the tertiary period. This fact alone is sufficient
to make its unintelligibleness clear to every
one who is not penetrated by the conviction of
the infallibility of the theory of the gradual transmutation
of and progressive development of all
organized creatures. If, however, we now find
one of the most man-like apes (gibbon) in the
tertiary period, and this species is still in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
low grade, and side by side with it, at the end
of the ice period, man is found in the same high
grade as to-day, the ape not having approximated
more nearly to man, and modern man not having
become further removed from the ape than the
first man, every one who is in a position to draw a
right conclusion can infer, that the facts contradict
a theory of constant progression, development
and ceaselessly increasing variation from
generation to generation, as surely as it is possible
to do." (<em>Age and Origin of Man</em>, Am. Tr.
Soc., p. 52.)</p>

<p>From time to time the discovery of the "missing
link" is announced and telegraphed through
the civilized world, only to be remanded to its
place among the remains of brutes or men. We
will consider the instances of such as they have
been presented:</p>

<p>1. The Calaveras Skull now in the California
State Museum. This has been shown recently to
be a hoax. It was placed in a mine shaft 150 feet
deep, by Mr. R. C. Scribner, a storekeeper at the
mine, as a practical joke. This he lately acknowledged
to the Rev. W. H. Dyer, of Los Angeles, a
clergyman of the Episcopal church.</p>

<p>2. The Neanderthal Skull. This was found in
1856 in Prussia. It had narrow receding forehead
and thick ridges over the eyes. It was claimed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the evolutionists as from two to three hundred
thousand years old. Dr. Meyer of Bonn examined
the evidence, and found it to be the skull of a Cossack
killed in 1814. Many other scientists agreed
with him. (<em>Bible Science and Faith</em>, p. 278.)</p>

<p>3. The Colorado specimen. Prof. Stephen
Bowers of the Mineralogical and Geological Survey
of California, gives this account of another
such discovery: "A few years ago the newspapers
contained an account of the discovery of a
skeleton in Colorado, by a Columbia College professor,
which he was pleased to call the 'missing
link' between man and the apes. He gave this
remarkable creature an antiquity of a million and
a half of years. The friable bones were carefully
wrapped in cotton and shipped east. But scarcely
had the learned professor gotten away with his
prize when certain cowboys came forward and
claimed the bones to be that of a pet monkey
which they buried but a dozen years previously."</p>

<p>4. The late find of skeletons at Croatia, Austria,
is heralded as the discovery of a connecting link.
But these are skeletons of men and not of brutes.
They are degraded men and nothing is better
known than the possibility of degeneracy in man.
We have degenerates now with all the peculiarities
of these low specimens, retreating brows and
jaws and flat faces. Degeneracy does not prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
evolution. While the shape of these skulls is low
and long it has not been shown that their cubical
capacity is much less than that of normal man.</p>

<p>5. The Pithecanthropus Erectus. This is the
most popular relic with Evolution. It consists
of a piece of a skull from the eyes upward, a leg
bone and two teeth. These were found in Java
by Dr. von Eugene Du Bois in 1891. The cubic
measurement of the skull is 60 inches, the same as
that of an idiot, that of a normal man being 90
inches, and of an ape 30. These specimens were
found at separate places and times. The skull is
too small for the thigh bone. The age of the strata
in which they were found is uncertain. Authorities
are divided as to the nature of these.
Haeckel admits that the belief that this is the missing
link is strongly combatted by some distinguished
scientists. At the Leyden congress,
it was attacked by the illustrious pathologist
Rudolph Virchow.</p>

<p>The assumptions based upon this specimen and
necessary for evidence are as follows: First, that
it is as old as claimed, a hundred thousand years
at least, or a million as stated by some. Second,
that these bones belong to the same individual.
Third, that they are the remains of a full-grown
individual. Fourth, that they are the remains of
a human or semi-human being. Fifth, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
are not the remains of an idiot whose capacity the
brain represents.</p>

<p>With all these unproven assumptions, and
against the opinion of many of the finest scientists
in Europe, Haeckel and some evolutionists have
declared this is the missing link. They place this
piece of a skull of one creature upon this leg of
another and insert these teeth belonging to a third,
all so far separated in life that they probably did
not even know each other, and rechristen the
whole "Pithecanthropus Erectus," which may be
freely translated "The ape that walked like a
man," being thus the first that arrived at that
point which Prof. Clodd tells us was "the making
of a man." And this specimen is Haeckel's <em>Last
Link</em>, and this he says demonstrates the truth of
Evolution.</p>

<p>The evidence of bones and other remains is
now generally suspected. It has been found that
even in the case of recent remains, as in criminal
trials, experts are often unable to decide whether
they are human or brute, recent or remote, and
what part of the frame they occupied. It is said
that Wallace, the great cotemporary with Darwin
in the promotion of the theory, now admits
there is no evidence of an evolutionary link between
man and the lower animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>


<h4>7. THE ARGUMENT FROM THE BRAIN.</h4>

<p>The brain forms the principal difference between
man's body and the brute's. The brain is
especially used as proof by the evolutionist. It
is the organ of mind. Its size corresponds with
the intellectual state of the creature. It is the
theory of Evolution that there was an increase in
the size of the brain in some of the man-apes of
that day, although none such is seen now.</p>

<p>Prof. Edward Clodd thus describes these supposed
brain changes after the Ice Age: "The
changes by which he met these new conditions
were in a very small degree physical. They were
almost wholly mental. The principal physical
change was in the growth of the brain and the expansion
of the cranium, giving rise to a less
bestial physiognomy and an advanced mental
power." (<em>Man and His Ancestor</em>, p. 181.)</p>

<p>How could man adapt himself by increasing the
size of his brain? Why should the passing away
of the ice age increase the size of the brain?
However, he disposes of the whole matter, after
arguing through pages of supposition and assumption,
by stating, "The absence of facts forces
us to confine ourselves largely to suggestions and
probabilities." (<em>Making of a Man</em>, p. 188.) But
probabilities are not science and we have a right
to ask from those claiming to be scientists actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
facts and not guesses, for so great an assertion
as the descent of man from the brute.</p>

<p>The capacity of the ape brain is 30, of the human
90 cubic inches. There is no evidence of
change in either the ape or the man. The prehistoric
man has as good a head on his shoulders
as his modern descendants. Bruner says the most
ancient skulls even exceed ours. Dr. Pfaff says
the stone age men are equal to the present generation.
So if education does not increase the
size of man's brain, why should the new tricks of
Prof. Clodd's ancient "arboreal creature" enlarge
that individual's brain 200 per cent? On the other
hand, the ape of to-day and the ape of 3,000 years
ago as mummied and preserved in Egypt are the
same. The big-brained ape of Evolution has unaccountably
disappeared and even his skull is
missing.</p>


<h4>8. MAN'S MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS.</h4>

<p>Evolution claims that all man's faculties have
been derived from the brute, as was his physical
frame. It is fair to say that this is met at the door
by the protest of some of the greatest scientists,
themselves sympathetic with Evolution.</p>

<p>Prof. John Fiske wrote on the origin of mind:
"We can say when mind came on the scene of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
evolution, but we can say neither whence nor
why.... It is not only inconceivable how
mind should have been produced from matter,
but it is inconceivable that it should have been
produced from matter." (<em>Darwinism</em>, pp. 63, 69.)
Prof. Dana has said, "The present teaching of
geology is that man is not of nature's making....
Independently of such evidences, man's
high reason, his unsatisfied longings, aspirations,
his free will, all afford the fullest assurance that
he owes his existence to the special act of the
Infinite Being whose image he bears." (<em>Geologic
Story</em>, p. 290.)</p>

<p>Prof. George H. Howison writes on this theme:
"To make evolution the ground of the existence
of mind in man, is destructive to the reality of the
human person and therefore, of the entire world
of moral good and of unqualified truth." (<em>Limits
of Evolution</em>, p. 6.) Lord Kelvin, the most eminent
living scientist, wrote in a letter to the London
Times, "Every action of human free will is a
miracle to physical and chemical and mathematical
science."</p>


<h4>9. LANGUAGE.</h4>

<p>Evolution has long tried to create an argument
for the derivation of man's speech from the cries
of animals. This is met however by the philologist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
with positive denial. Prof. Max Mueller
says: "There is one barrier which no one has yet
ventured to touch,&mdash;the barrier of language.
Language is our Rubicon and no brute will dare
to cross it.... No process of Natural Selection
will ever distill significant words out of
the notes of birds and animals." (<em>Lessons on the
Science of Language</em>, pp. 23, 340, 370.)</p>

<p>False claims have been made for the languages
of savage people and ancient races. Darwin said
that the people of Terra del Fuego were the lowest
in the scale, so far as discovered, and their
language correspondingly crude. But further investigation
shows that they have 32,430 words;
over twice as many as Shakespeare used. The
language of some of the tribes of the Congo is
described by a missionary as more complex than
Greek. The history of languages shows the same
want of evidence for an evolutionary origin. The
oldest forms are the most complex. Modern
Greek and Latin are simpler than the ancient
forms. English is an improvement in this respect
on the old Anglo Saxon, whose grammatical
forms it has largely cast off and reduced the
language to greater simplicity.</p>

<p>A scientist is now endeavoring to ascertain the
speech of monkeys. He has ascertained that these
animals have different sounds for different wants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
a fact as to other creatures that he could have
ascertained by a visit to the nearest poultry yard.
The hen has as many calls as the monkey, and as
many meanings too. Her call for food is one
sound. Her cry of alarm at a passing hawk is
another, and her brood perfectly understands all,
and without previous education. All animals and
birds, and many insects too, have sounds with
meaning in them, but language is another matter.</p>


<h4>10. PREHISTORIC MAN.</h4>

<p>The remains of early races form an argument
used by Evolution. These remains are found in
many places in caves and are accompanied by tools
of stone and vessels of pottery and the remains of
animals. These degraded peoples are pointed to
by Evolution as man in a state of development.</p>

<p>If the preceding arguments were well founded
this would appear reasonable enough. But in
view of the fallacious character of the prior
reasoning, we must halt at this claim. There are
many and conclusive reasons for rejecting this
unproven claim. For it is unproven. It is only
inference and assumption.</p>

<p>1. These men of the cave do not necessarily
represent man in a course of progress, for we
find to-day the same classes of people with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
stone tools and pottery and living as prehistoric
man lived. There to-day exist men in every stage
of the supposed progress from the cave man to
the highest in civilization. Such remains could
be had in any burial place of these savage peoples.
Prehistoric man, so-called, is still with us and we
can interview him as to his state and history.</p>

<p>2. We have seen that modern man has not developed
in brain capacity above prehistoric man.
It is also true that he has not developed physically.
Dana tells us that the skeleton found at Mentone
compares favorably with the best modern men.
Indeed we have degenerated in many respects.
We have almost lost the sense of smell as compared
with savage peoples or even animals. Our
teeth are certainly not improving. If we are to
find perfect specimens we do not look at the most
advanced classes but to the reverse. Those who
live to extreme old age are generally in the lowly
ranks. But why has physical development ceased
at all? Why are there not some superior beings
by this time? But alas, there are no marks or indications
of wings or halos on either the great
saints or scientists of the day.</p>

<p>We are told that while physical evolution has
ceased among men, evolution now works along
mental lines of progress. This is a radical shifting
of the ground of evolution, for heretofore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
all this has been not only omitted but discarded.
If evolution is anything, it is physical. Nor does
Evolution give any account of the causes of the
stoppage of physical development and the change
to mental evolution. We will also show later that
this supposed progress has not been such as
claimed.</p>


<h4>11. ANTIQUITY OF MAN.</h4>

<p>Evolution asserts that a vast antiquity for man
has been proven by remains that have been found.
It is commonly said that these remains are hundreds
of thousands of years old. But the claims
for these vast periods are now being greatly reduced
and generally discredited. Dr. Zahm says
of these speculations: "We could not give a better
illustration of the extremes to which the unguided
human intellect is subject than the vacillating and
extravagant notions of the antiquity of man."
(<em>Bible Science and Faith</em>, p. 315.) The age of
the peat beds of Abbeville, in France, in which
human remains were found, was once estimated at
20,000 years. The estimate has been reduced to a
fifth of that age. The remains of the animals
found with man are supposed to prove his extreme
antiquity. The remains of the mammoth
were once cited as such proof. But the mammoth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
has been found in such a state of preservation that
its flesh has been fed to the dogs.</p>

<p>The enormous ages which have been credited
to these remains are well illustrated by the discovery
of a skeleton at New Orleans while digging
for the gas works. From the depth of the
stratum in which it was found it was estimated by
scientists at the age of 57,000 years. Soon after,
the gunwale of the skeleton's Kentucky flat boat
was found in the same stratum, and the age therefore
of the remains was reduced from 57,000 to
50 years. The evidences from peat bogs, stalagmite
formations, stone, iron and bronze tools are
all now considered unreliable by scientists. So
many exposures of mistakes in the estimate of
age from these have been made, that the whole is
looked upon with suspicion. Instance after instance
might be given.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that we can arrange these
past races in an ascending order as they worked
in stone, bronze, or iron, in their successive history.
This is a false theory. We have all these
"ages" existing to-day. On the other hand, Dr.
Livingstone found no stone age in Africa. Dr.
Schliemann found in the ruins of Troy the bronze
age below the stone age. The early Egyptians
used bronze, the later ones stone tools. In the
Chaldean tombs all these are found together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Europe had the metal age while America had the
stone age. (<em>Creation and Evolution.</em> Prof.
Townsend.)</p>

<p>These prehistoric races to which Evolution
points us as representing man in his early state,
do not represent that early world. They are found
at the outer limits of the world and not at the
acknowledged center whence man came. They
are, in short, what we find to-day at the outlying
regions of earth. They therefore, are exceptional
peoples and not representative of the world at
that time, or now.</p>

<p>The dynasties of Egypt were once cited against
the Bible narrative, but these have been reduced
to moderate figures. A thousand years was taken
off by one discoverer recently from the age of
the middle kingdom. There is a question whether
the Egyptian dynasties were successive or in some
cases contemporary. There is also the well-known
fact that the Egyptians had years of varying
length. They often counted dynasties by years of
three months and also of a month! Dr. Flinders
Petrie lately discovered in the tombs of the kings,
preceding the first dynasty of Egypt at Abydos,
Grecian pottery of Mycean clay, and this in a tomb
estimated to date from 5,400 B. C.! (<em>Atlantic
Monthly</em>, October, 1900.)</p>

<p>The same kind of estimating is now being done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
from the Assyrian tablets and their records. We
must remember these old kings were great boasters
and liars, too. We don't know the basis of
their calculations. Perhaps Assyria also had three
month years. If their method was like Egypt's,
and they were connected as we know by much intercourse
and literature, we may expect like inaccuracy.
The ancient dates given in the inscriptions
found in Nuffar recently, are already suspected
by scholars. The date for the temple uncovered
there was 3,200 B. C. This number is
the product of forty multiplied by eighty; evidently
a round number for eighty generations, and
not at all a careful or exact chronological statement.</p>

<p>However, let us compare the two accounts, the
Bible and the Assyrian. The one precise in statement,
accurate in ten thousand points as demonstrated,
with us for thousands of years, trusted
and tried. The other inexact, mythical in its
legends, having all the marks of inaccuracy, just
discovered, made by people we know nothing of
and having no character to speak of, and full of
vain boastings and absurd claims. Which is the
true and which the false? Let the jury decide.
We will abide the verdict.</p>

<p>Prof. A. H. Sayce of Oxford, writes: "The
light that has come from the remnants of the past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
has been fatal to the pretenses of critical skepticism.
The discoveries of Abydos have discredited
its methods and results. They have shown that
where they can be tested they prove to be absolutely
worthless. It is only reasonable to conclude
that methods and results, that thus break
down under the test of monumental discovery,
must equally break down in other departments of
history where no such test can be applied. It is
not the discoveries of the higher critics, but the
old traditions which have been confirmed by
archaeological discovery." (<em>Homiletic Review</em>,
March, 1901.) This statement is made by one of
the most able archaeologists and semitic scholars
in the world.</p>

<p>The age of man on earth has much testimony
from science agreeing with the Bible account.
From many the following are cited:</p>

<p>Dr. J. A. Zahm, the distinguished scholar, says,
"I am disposed to attribute to man an antiquity of
about ten thousand years. It seems likely that the
general consensus of chronologists will ultimately
fix on a date which shall be below rather than
above ten thousand years as the nearest approximate
to the age of our race." (<em>The Bible, Science
and Faith</em>, p. 311.) He quotes many other authorities.</p>

<p>Prof. Winchell tells us, "The very beginnings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of our race are still almost in sight." (<em>Sketches of
Creation.</em>) Dawson thinks man has been on earth
about seven thousand years. Geology agrees that
man did not exist before the ice age. The stone
age is fixed at about seven thousand years ago
by others.</p>

<p>Professor George Frederick Wright tells us,
"The glacial period did not close more than ten
thousand years ago. This shortening of our conception
of the ice age renders glacial man a comparatively
modern creature. The last stage of
the excessive unstability of the earth was not so
very long ago and continued down to near the
introduction of man." (<em>Bibliotheca Sacra</em>, April,
1902.)</p>

<p>S. R. Pattison, F. G. S., tells us, "Science shows
to us a number of converging probabilities which
point to man's first appearance along with great
animals about 8,000 years ago." (<em>Age and Origin
of Man Geologically Considered, Am. Tr. Soc.</em>,
p. 29.)</p>

<p>Dr. Friedrich Pfaff, professor of natural science
in Erlangen, thus sums up the evidence from
geology as to man: "(1) The age of man is small,
extending only to a few thousand years. (2)
Man appeared suddenly: the most ancient man
known to us is not essentially different from the
now living man. (3) Transitions from the ape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to the man, or the man to the ape, are nowhere
found. The conclusion we are led to is that the
Scripture account of man, which is one and self-consistent,
is true.... This account of man
we accept by faith, because it is revealed by God,
is supported by adequate evidence, solves the
otherwise insoluble problems, not only of science
and history, but of inward experience, and meets
our deepest need.... The more it is sifted
and examined the more well founded and irrefragable
does it prove to be." (<em>Age and Origin of
Man</em>, Am. Tr. Soc., pp. 55-56.)</p>


<h4>12. SAVAGE RACES.</h4>

<p>Evolution delights to compare savage peoples
alternately with present civilized races and with
the brute. Prof. Conn says, "There is a greater
difference between a Newton and a Hottentot,
than between the Hottentot and the orang-outang."
He fails to notice, or state, that the first
is a difference of degree only, and the latter a
difference of kind. It would be possible to develop
a Hottentot into a philosopher, but no attempt is
ever dreamed of, to change an orang-outang into
a Hottentot. On the other hand, the lowest savages
have under culture shown their human inheritance
of faculties beyond the brute. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
pigmies taken to Italy learned to speak Italian in
two years with fluency. They showed themselves
superior to many European children, and one became
proficient in music. The skill of this race
with poisoned arrows, pits for game, and cultivation
of various kinds, is well known.</p>

<p>The savage races show the opposite of evolution.
They are races in ruins. Max Mueller says,
"What do we know of savage tribes beyond the
last chapter in their history? They may have
passed through ever so many vicissitudes, and
what we consider as primitive may be for all we
know a relapse into savagery, or corruption of
what was something more rational and intelligible
in former ages." This estimate of this great
scholar is attested by facts. Where to-day is the
Hindu race that could build the Taj Mahal?
What Greek race to-day could reproduce the
architecture or statuary of their ancestors? The
ruins of all eastern and many western lands point
to fallen races as well as ruined structures. The
world's history is that of the fall of great nations
such as Egypt, Babylonia, Greece, Rome, in all
of which are sad examples of architecture and
peoples alike in decay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>


<h4>13. THE ARGUMENT FROM HISTORY.</h4>

<p>History is appealed to to show the progress of
man and his continuance in the evolutionary line
since his origin in the brute. Our present civilization
is pointed to and compared with the past
and we are told that this is the result of evolution.</p>

<p>Some remarks of a preliminary kind are called
for here. It is to be remembered that history
does not cover a very long period, that the record
is often broken, and that the facts are often very
uncertain. Large sections of the world we know
historically nothing or little of, such as Asia and
Africa. We must remember that progress is confined
mostly to Europe and America and these
form but a third of the population of the world.
Also that European progress is a comparatively
recent matter. We are now considering the entire
history of the race and must take in these
vast outside regions to arrive at correct
conclusions. To judge the entire progress of
mankind from a short-sighted view of a limited
portion is as unscientific as it is unscriptural.</p>

<p>We must also remember that Europe owes its
progress to the influence of Christianity. For to-day
it is the Christian nations only that have progress
and the most Christian have the most progress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
No fact is better seen or proven. Lange
states, "Among human tribes left to themselves,
the higher man never comes out of the lower.
Apparent exceptions do ever, on close examination,
confirm the universality of the rule in regard
to particular peoples, while the claim, as
made for the world's general progress, can only
be urged in opposition by ignoring the supernal
aids of revelation that have ever shown themselves
directly or collaterally on the human path."
(<em>Commentary on Genesis</em>, p. 355.) We have seen
that so far as present savage races are concerned
they have made no progress, and semi-civilized
races, such as the Egyptians, Chinese and Hindus
have retrograded.</p>

<p>We need also to consider the vast and great
civilizations which existed in remote antiquity as
is now revealed by archaeology. The recent discoveries
in Assyria and Babylonia and Egypt
show vast empires of culture as well as national
extension and power, and that their earlier culture
was the greatest. So Prof. Hilprecht, of the University
of Pennsylvania, testifies of Babylonia:
"The flower of Babylonian art is found at the beginning
of Babylonian history." (<em>Recent Researches
in Bible Lands</em>, p. 88.) Horace Bushnell
tells us, "All great ruins are but a name for greatness
in ruins."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>It is to Egypt we must go for the earliest
records of human civilization. Here the account
of Prof. Sayce, of Oxford, gives us the facts:
"The earliest culture and civilization to which the
monuments bear witness was in fact already perfect.
It was full-grown. The organization of the
country was complete. The arts were known and
practiced. Egyptian culture as far as we know
at present has no beginning." (<em>Recent Researches
in Bible Lands</em>, pp. 101, 102.) "The older the
culture, the more perfect it is found to be. The
fact is a very remarkable one, in view of modern
theories of development and of the evolution of
civilization out of barbarism. Whatever may be
the reason, such theories are not borne out by the
discoveries of archaeology. Instead of the progress
one should expect, we find retrogression
and decay. Is it possible the Biblical view is
right after all and that civilized man has been
civilized from the outset?" (<em>Homiletic Review</em>,
June, 1902.) Prof. Flinders Petrie tells us that
the Great Pyramid bears on its stones the marks
of the solid and tubular drill, edged with stone as
hard as diamond, and cutting one-tenth of an
inch at a revolution, and showing no sign of wear.
They had also straight and circular saws. The
same building reveals scientific and astronomical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
knowledge equal in some respects to modern
science.</p>

<p>Not only were the past civilizations great, but,
in many respects, far above the present. So that
the race has even fallen from higher levels. Lecky
thus writes of the Greeks: "Within the narrow
limits and scant populations of the Greek states,
arose men, who in almost every conceivable form
of genius, in philosophy, in epic, dramatic and
lyric poetry, in written and spoken eloquence, in
statesmanship, in sculpture, in painting, and probably
in music, attained the highest levels of human
perfection." (<em>History of European Morals</em>, p.
408.) Galton says of the same civilization: "The
millions of Europe, breeding as they have for two
thousand years, have never produced the equal of
Socrates and Phidias. The average ability of the
Athenian race is, on the lowest possible estimate,
nearly two grades higher than our own; that is,
about as much as our race is above the African
negro." (<em>Hereditary Genius</em>, p. 320.)</p>

<p>It does seem as if such testimony of these great
scholars should make us not only chary of the theory
which claims ever upward and onward progress,
but also more modest in our boasted modern
progress and position. Prof. Frederick Starr of
the Anthropological department of Chicago University,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
says that the American race is reverting
to the Indian state. He bases this on measurements
of faces of 5,000 children. This is a dismal
outlook. It is not what Evolution has promised
us. The followers of Evolution have reason to be
indignant at such a turn in its course. However,
we may comfort them and ourselves with the hope
that if Evolution fails us we have other resources.</p>


<h3>EVOLUTION AND RELIGION.</h3>

<p>Consciousness of God and the hereafter is the
great distinction between man and brute. This is
the basis of all religion. Of this Evolution gives
the origin in the dreams of animals.</p>

<p>According to that department of the evolutionary
theory popularly called Higher Criticism, all
religion, including Israel's and Christianity,
was derived from fetishism and from that it developed
to animism, and so to polytheism and
finally monotheism. But the lowest savages have,
according to anthropology, the belief in a Supreme
Being. Andrew Lang says, "It is among the lowest
savages that the Supreme Beings are regarded
as eternal, moral, powerful." (<em>Making of Religion</em>,
p. 206.) Fetishism and animism are processes
of decay, says Dr. John Smith, quoting
Hartmann, DeRouge, Renouf, Lang and others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
(<em>Integrity of Scripture</em>, p. 68.) Traces of monotheism
are found in China, India, Egypt and elsewhere.
In all nations is this decay found save in
one, Israel.</p>

<p>It is further found that mankind had an original
theistic religion common to the race, which is just
what the Bible teaches. All the evidence is to the
effect that the further back we go, the purer the
religions are found to be. The earliest Romans
were more pure in religion than the later people.
The early Greeks more so than the more recent.
The early handwritings give a purer and more
theistic religion than the later books. Dr. Jacob
Chamberlain thus sums up the evidence for the
Hindu Vedas: "They all teach the Godhead is
one, that he is good, that man is in a state of sin,
not at peace with the Holy One, that man is in
need of holiness and purity, that there can be no
harmony between sinful man and a holy God unless
sin is in some way expiated and expurgated,
and that this is the greatest and most worthy end
of existence." (<em>Northfield Echoes</em>, August, 1900,
p. 256.)</p>

<p>The ruins of Assyria and Egypt point to a religion
resembling that of the Israelites. So far is
this noticed that some have said that Moses copied
much of what he taught Israel from them. This
conclusion is not necessary. The fact is that man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
had a deposit of truth at the beginning, and all
men had the same. Both Moses and Egypt and
Assyria therefore, had much of what survived
from that early revelation. The fact here stated
agrees with the Bible account and not with Evolution.</p>

<p>"The study of the mythology and philosophy of
the heathen world does not show an evolutionary
progress to a higher state, but the reverse."
(Francis M. Bruner in <em>The Evolution Theory</em>.)
Christianity has not been a development of these
religions, for it is and was, antagonistic to them
at every point. It was an opposing force introduced
suddenly and utterly at variance in every
particular with all about it.</p>

<p>Sir M. Monier said in an address in 1887:
"There can be no greater mistake than to force
these non-christian writings into conformity with
some scientific theory of development, and then
point to the Christian's Holy Bible as the crowning
product of religious evolution. So far from
this, these non-christian books are all developments
in the wrong direction. They begin with
some flashes of true light and end in utter darkness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>


<h3>EVOLUTION AND ETHICS.</h3>

<p>Evolution has a system or systems of Ethics.
It traces the beginning of the sense of right and
wrong to the instincts of animals, such as the
parental instinct, the recognition of marital rights,
and the right to respective properties such as nests
and burrows. So that the animal, or man, came
to see that it was best on all accounts to be good
to oneself and others. So Mr. Spencer's definition
of right is the happiness of oneself, one's offspring
and others. Acts are good or bad as they
increase happiness or misery. He ignores the
moral instinct and exalts expediency and utility.
This is the level of the uncivilized or savage
races.</p>

<p>Dr. James Thompson Bixby of Leipsic, makes
humanity the goal of Evolution's ethics. "The
test of what is morally good is the tendency of
the given motive to help forward the progress of
the race toward the ideal humanity." (<em>Ethics of
Evolution</em>, p. 212.) Every Bible believer will see
how far short these fall of the standard of holiness
and happiness the Bible places before us.
But when or where did any people ever aim to
help forward the "ideal perfection of humanity"
who did not have the mighty impulse which the
Bible, and only the Bible, gives to that object?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
There is not even the sense of brotherhood necessary
for the motive. To point natural man to
that is to ask him to act outside his nature.</p>

<p>The law of the Struggle for Existence never
taught Christian ethics. The self-sacrificing
Christian has something which never came
from Evolution. The Cross is the final
test of Evolution. By it that theory and
all other false theories are weighed in the balances
and found wanting. The struggle for existence
is the law of self and is the antithesis of the Cross,
which is the very opposite of the struggle for existence.
Nor is the struggle for existence the law
of the lower creature. That law is to bring forth
fruit, to propagate their species. That is the
plant's goal; when it has so done it retires or dies.
The little bird will struggle more fiercely for its
young than for its food, or even for its life, which
it imperils often to save its brood. Below the unfallen
creation and regenerated humanity is the
unregenerated selfish man. Not Evolution but
Revolution can create Christian ethics. History
does not present an instance of progress in ethics
save as aided by the Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>


<h3>EVOLUTION AND CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE.</h3>

<p>In undertaking to account for man, Evolution
must account for the fact of Christian experience.
Conversion revolutionizes a man. It turns him
against his natural likes and dislikes. He even
turns against himself and the selfish becomes unselfish.
This is not development, for that operates
according to the nature of the thing. Develop a
wolf and you may get a dog. Develop man from
the savage state and you may have the condition
of the Greek in the highest state of culture and
yet in the lowest state of vice. Introduce Christian
experience and you have Christianity with all
the civilization which proceeds and flows from it.</p>

<p>There is no such consistent body of testimony
for any fact, science or truth as there is for Christian
experience. It is the same in all ages, in all
lands and in all classes of society, and in all circumstances
of life. This evidence is perfectly legitimate
and must be considered by the student of
human life and character. Let Evolution then account
for Conversion which changes man's inner
nature, and gives a life which lives contrary to
natural human instincts and conduct; and Christian
hopes which yearn for deliverance from sin
and self and long for the highest spiritual state
and hasten to meet the holy and all-seeing God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>The missions of our great cities as well as those
of the foreign field are full of witnesses for the
transforming effect of Christian experience.
The author of this book can vouch for the following
from personal knowledge. A business
man in Illinois became addicted partly from use
in disease to alcohol and the use of morphine and
also cocaine. He used all these and in excessive
quantities; as much as forty grains of morphine
in a day. He tried seven "cures." He visited
Europe to consult specialists. He spent in all
over $15,000 in seeking a cure and all in vain.
By the persuasions of Christians he was led to
seek relief in prayer and experienced what Christians
call conversion and was immediately delivered
from all his appetites. The author of this
saw him three months after and found him a
sober man and without any desire for drink or
drugs. He saw him again a year after and he
was still rejoicing in full deliverance. Since beginning
this book, a correspondence was had to
verify the case still further, and he is reported as
follows: "In January, 1899, his weight was 113
pounds. In January, 1901, his weight was 183
pounds. He is an official member of a prominent
church, a director of the Young Men's Christian
Association and a great worker in both." No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
evolution can account for such a change. It is as
great a miracle as cleansing the leper.</p>

<p>Prof. George Romanes of Oxford, was, it is
said, brought back from infidelity to faith by the
letters of a Japanese missionary friend, dealing
with experimental and practical religion. Evolution
asks for facts. Here are facts, and they
tell not of Evolution but of Regeneration.</p>


<h3>EVOLUTION AND CHRIST.</h3>

<p>Evolution cannot account for Christ. Without
entering here on an argument for His divinity,
we simply present him and ask the evolutionist
to account for such a character and life. Let us
listen to what the enemies of Christianity say of
Christ.</p>

<p>Renan said: "The incomparable man to whom
the universal conscience has decreed the title of
the Son of God, and that with justice....
Between thee and God there will be no longer
any distinction."</p>

<p>Jean Paul Richter said: "The holiest among
the mighty, the mightiest among the holy, He
lifted with pierced hands empires off their hinges
and turned the stream of centuries out of its channel
and still governs the ages." (Dr. Liddon's
<em>Bampton Lectures</em>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Rousseau testified as follows: "What sweetness,
what purity in his morals! What force, what
persuasion in his instructions! His maxims how
sublime! His discourses, how wise and profound!
such presence of mind, such beauty and
precision in his answers, such empire over his
passions! It would be much harder to conceive
that a number of men should have joined together
to fabricate this book than that a single person
should furnish out the subject to its authors.
Jewish writers would never have fallen into that
style, and the gospel has such strong and such
inimitable marks of truth that the inventor would
be more surprising than the hero." (<em>Emilius and
Sophia</em>, or An Essay on Education, pp. 79, 80,
81.)</p>

<p>Thomas Paine: "The morality that he preached
and practiced was of the most benevolent kind.
It has never been excelled." (<em>Age of Reason</em>, p.
5.)</p>

<p>Robert Ingersoll, to M. D. Landon, in a letter
giving permission to print his speeches: "In using
my speeches do not use any assault I may have
made on Christ which I foolishly made in my
earlier life. I believe Christ was the perfect man.
'Do unto others' is the perfection of religion and
morality. It is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum bonum</i>." (<cite>Homiletic
Review</cite>, November, 1899, p. 475.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Theodore Parker: "Shall we be told such a
man never lived&mdash;the whole story is a lie? Suppose
that Plato and Newton never lived, that their
story is a lie? But who did their works and
thought their thoughts? It takes a Newton to
forge a Newton. What man could have fabricated
Jesus? None but a Jesus." (<cite>Discourses on Religion</cite>,
pp. 362-3.)</p>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte: "Everything in Jesus
Christ astonishes me. His spirit overawes me.
Between him and whoever else in the world there
is no possible line of comparison. I search in
vain in history to find the similar to Jesus Christ,
or anything which can approach the Gospel. In
him we find a moral beauty before unknown, and
an idea of the Supreme superior even to that
which creation suggests."</p>

<p>To say that Jesus was an evolution of that age,
as some evolutionists do say, and that we may
look for even a greater in the future, is to be
guilty not only of blasphemy but of gross ignorance
as to the age in which Jesus came. There
was nothing in that age to give rise to such a character.
He came as a flash of lightning in a dark
sky, or, according to the Bible figure, as the rising
of the sun in the world's night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>EVOLUTION UNSCIENTIFIC AND UNPHILOSOPHICAL.</h3>


<p>Before making so serious a charge against a
scientific theory as that it is both unscientific
and unphilosophical, we will show that others
have held a similar view and that among these
are many scholars. We have already seen Prof.
Paulsen's remark that Haeckel's reasonings are
a "disgrace to the philosophy of Germany." Prof.
George Frederick Wright calls Evolution a "fad,"
"the cast-off clothing of the evolutionary philosophy
of fifty years ago." The Duke of Argyle
says, "It is such a violation of and departure
from all that we know of the existing order of
things as to deprive it of all scientific base."</p>


<h4>EVOLUTION FAILS IN ALL THE STEPS OF SCIENTIFIC
PROOF.</h4>

<p>There are four stages of proof necessary for a
full demonstration.</p>

<p>1. Observation of facts.</p>

<p>2. Classification of these facts.</p>

<p>3. Inferences legitimately drawn therefrom.</p>

<p>4. Verification of these conclusions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>1. It fails in its facts. That this is true is evident
from the reticence of the exact scientists to
commit themselves to the theory. If the facts
were all that they say, these laborious and faithful
laborers in the laboratory and field would
acknowledge the case. In the presentation of
facts, the theoretical evolutionist culls out and
magnifies those looking his way and passes in
silence or minifies those antagonistic to the theory.
It makes much of the change of a low salt water
animal into its fresh water form, and passes over
the immutability of all the great species. Evolution
dwells upon the splints in the leg of the horse
and passes over lightly the vast unbridged gaps
between organic and inorganic matter, the origin
of the vertebrates, the countless missing links between
the species. It rests its argument on the
"gill-slits" in the necks of embryonic fish, puppies
and infants, and passes airily over the origin
of matter, of life, of consciousness and of Christian
experience. It presents ex-parte evidence.</p>

<p>2. Evolution fails in classification. We have
seen the testimony of Evolution itself on this
point. Nor is there any agreed definition of
species. Not a single species has been traced to its
origin. The species defy chronological classification.
The most primitive species exist to-day
and the most advanced were in existence almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
at the first. Nor can the classifications which are
attempted be advanced as proof of evolution.
They are as evidential of manufacture or of creation
or of any other process of intelligent mind.</p>

<p>3. Evolution rests on inferences. As its great
philosopher, Spencer, has said, no inference is
warranted unless it accounts for all the facts.
Not only does no inference of Evolution do this,
but it admits again and again that it is beset with
countless difficulties. Nor are these inferences
the only ones that might be drawn. It is not only
necessary to draw an inference but to show that
no other inference is possible. Some of these are
the wildest possible deductions from the facts,&mdash;as
for example, the theories as to the origins, already
cited, as to whales and giraffes. Sir J.
William Dawson, the eminent geologist, says of
Evolution's deductions as follows: "It seems to
indicate that the accumulated facts of our age
have gone altogether beyond its capacity for generalization,
and but for the vigor which one sees
everywhere, it might be taken as an indication
that the human mind has fallen into a state of
senility and in its dotage mistakes for science the
imaginations which are the dreams of its youth."
(<cite>Story of the Earth and Man</cite>, p. 317.)</p>

<p>The works of writers on Evolution abound in
such phrases as "seems to be&mdash;I infer&mdash;it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
conceivable&mdash;it might have been&mdash;it is probable&mdash;I
think&mdash;apparently&mdash;must have been&mdash;no one can
say&mdash;not difficult to conceive,"&mdash;and other unscientific
terms, and on such deductions they project
other inferences, and so leap skilfully from one
supposition to another across the quagmire of
Evolution.</p>

<p>Evolution is undertaking a philosophical impossibility&mdash;the
proving of a negative, that there
could be no other method than derivation. This
is the philosophical basis of the whole theory.</p>

<p>4. Finally Evolution fails in the fourth step. It
admits again and again that it has not demonstrated
its case. Not a single instance of evolution
of species has been shown or produced, and no
law of the change is given. The gaps it does not
bridge are many. We specially need to notice
that it gives no account of the origin of matter or
force. It can give no account of the origin of life.
It utterly fails to account for man's self-consciousness
or intellectual, moral or spiritual nature. It
takes no account whatever of the other world or
life and entirely disregards the facts of Christian
experience. In short, so far from being a
great universal philosophy, it is simply a disjointed
combination of unproven theories.</p>

<p>The evolutionist, Prof. Conn, admitting the
missing factors, says candidly, "It is therefore impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to make Evolution a complete theory."
(<cite>Evolution of To-day</cite>, p. 6.)</p>

<p>Sir J. William Dawson thus sums up the evidence:
"The simplicity and completeness of the
evolutionary theory entirely disappear when we
consider the unproved assumptions on which it is
based and its failure to connect with each other
some of the most important facts in nature; that
in short, it is not in any true sense a philosophy,
but a mere arbitrary arrangement of facts in accordance
with a number of unproved hypotheses.
Such philosophies, falsely so-called, have existed
ever since man began to reason on nature, and this
last of all is one of the weakest and most pernicious
of all. Let the reader take up either Darwin's
great book or Spencer's Biology and merely
ask, as he reads each paragraph, What is here
assumed and what is proved? and he will find the
fabric melt away like a vision. Spencer often exaggerates
or extenuates with reference to facts
and uses the art of the dialectician where argument
fails." (<cite>Story of the Earth and Man</cite>, p.
330.)</p>

<p>Prof. William Jones tells us Evolution is "a
metaphysical creed and nothing else; an emotional
attitude rather than a system of thought." (<cite>Homiletic
Review</cite>, August, 1900.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>


<h4>EVOLUTION RESTS ON IMAGINATION.</h4>

<p>The evolutionist not only uses his imagination
but claims the right to do so. Tyndall has written
an essay on the Scientific Use of the Imagination.
Now when the pictures of an evolutionist's imagination
are held up as facts, as in the description
of man's development from the brute, he leaves
the realm of science and enters that of fiction.
Mr. Gladstone has said of this: "To the eyes of
an onlooker their pace and method seem to be like
a steeple-chase. They are armed with a weapon
always sufficient if not always an arm of precision,
'the scientific imagination.' They are impatient
of that most wholesome state a Suspended Judgment."
(<cite>Homiletic Review</cite>, October, 1900,
quoted by Dr. Jesse B. Thomas.)</p>


<h4>EVOLUTION IS THE DOCTRINE OF CHANCE.</h4>

<p>The language used by the evolutionist is peculiar
for persons claiming to believe in law as the
great agency of nature and to base their conclusions
on the operation of fixed causes. The
changes which together make up the birth of a
new species are occasioned they say by "chance
happenings," "undesigned variations," "accidental
variations," "utterly undetermined antecedents,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
"unintentional variations," and other like expressions.
The synonyms of this idea are exhausted
by them in describing the way in which the
changes first occurred, by which one species began
the journey up to another stage of existence.
It is simply a revival and revamping of the old
doctrine of chance.</p>

<p>Prof. Frank Ballard says of this: "Chance
manufactured protoplasm out of nebulosity....
To accept this after rejecting faith on the ground
of its difficulty, is to quibble and cavil."</p>

<p>An illustration of the appeal to chance and its
use is found in the following account as given by
Prof. Ernst Haeckel, the greatest living teacher
of Evolution, of how tree-frogs became green:
"Once upon a time there were among the offspring
of ancestral tree-frogs some which among
other colors exhibited green, not much, perhaps
not even perceptible to our eyes. The occurrence
of this color was spontaneous, a freak. The descendants
of these greenish creatures, provided
they did not pair with frogs of the ordinary set,
became still greener and so on, until the green
was pronounced enough to be of advantage when
competition set in." (<cite>Last Link</cite>, p. 176.) Here
the origin of greenness in the tree-frog begins
with a chance happening and is promoted by a
chance union of the greenish frog with one not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
"the ordinary set," but of the more select circle
of the green, and the favoring chances continued
in this same remarkable way until the color became
of use in protecting them.</p>

<p>It was with similar chance happenings, Evolution
tells us, that all the great kingdoms, classes,
orders, families, genera and species originated.
It was by chance happenings that the present
beautiful and infinite variety of nature came. It
was by unintended accidents that the wonderful
adjustments in the universe came. It has been
calculated that the possibility of the letters of the
alphabet, if thrown promiscuously, coming together
in the present order is once in five hundred
million million million times. What would be
the chances of the innumerable combinations of
nature coming together in the order in which they
are by the chance happenings to which Evolution
attributes them?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>EVOLUTION AND THE BIBLE.</h3>


<p>The interest in the question of how things came
to be centers for the believer in the Bible narrative
and doctrine. We have been accustomed to bring
all things to Bible testing and so far with assured
results. The Bible has never failed and we believe
will not fail now. We therefore ask, What
does it teach as to Evolution? We are amazed to
find Evolution makes no appeal to the Bible, and
the Bible makes no allusion to Evolution. They
are strangers to each other. The argument from
Scripture for Evolution has not yet been written.
The best the theistic evolutionist can say as to
the Bible account of the origin of man is an
apology for its narratives, or some explanation
which vaporizes its facts into figures of speech.</p>

<p>We have heretofore given the Bible account and
that of Evolution printed in parallel columns
(p. 61). The reader is again referred to these,
and asked to notice the differences in these two
accounts. The Bible account is not the description
of the slow transformation of an ape into a
man-like ape, and that into an ape-like man, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
that into a cave man, and he into a stone-tool man,
and that again into a pottery-making savage, and
he into a weapon-making barbarian, and he into
a Chinese and after that into a Roman or Greek,
and last into an Englishman and American and
he into a spiritual being in the image and likeness
of God. Common literary honesty demands that
we give an author his own intended meaning. If
the Bible meant Evolution why did it not give it?
Two accounts more utterly dissimilar could
scarcely be given than the Bible account of man's
creation and the account of Evolution. We may
take one or other and be consistent but the rules
of literary exegesis and common sense and Scripture
alike forbid taking both.</p>

<p>To call it "poetry" or an "allegory" is no explanation.
Why did not the writer make poetry
or allegory which had some agreement with facts?
Why lead us into a perplexing situation when he
might as well have given us some other account
or omitted it altogether?</p>

<p>The differences between these two accounts
are obvious. The Bible account describes a
definite act, the Evolution account a long-continued
process through millions of years. The
Bible account is a production <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de novo</i> of a new
and original creature; the Evolution account gives
one of a numerous line of ancestors; the Bible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
account presents us with a perfect creature "in the
likeness of God;" the Evolution account with a
brute slightly raised above the common herd.
The Bible account gives a descriptive narrative
with accompanying events; the Evolution account
leaves all the events unknown save as guessed at
by the imagination of the various writers. The
Bible account gives a high and noble origin by a
special and creative act of his Creator; Evolution
tells of a degraded origin from a brute by the
operation of blind forces. The Bible account is
noble and satisfying and, to one who believes in an
omnipotent God, credible, calling for belief in one
creative act; the Evolution account is filled with
difficulties and paradoxes calling for the wildest
stretch of imagination and the utmost application
of credulity.</p>

<p>The Bible account is frequently referred to as
an actual history by other Scripture writers; the
evolutionary account has not one Scripture reference
or the slightest hint from Scripture of its
having any place whatever in fact. The Bible account
agrees with and is the basis of the spiritual
teachings of the Bible; the evolutionary account
has no such agreement and needs to be explained
away to be allowed any place whatever in sacred
writings. If the Bible is the book the common
consent of the wisest of all mankind and of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
age has affirmed it to be, it should have some intimation
of this "greatest discovery of the human
mind." For the Bible does touch on the greatest
problems of the world and life.</p>

<p>Not only does the Bible give a very different
account of the origin of man, but also of nature.
Its definition of the beginning of things is as follows:
"By faith we understand that the worlds
have been framed by the word of God, so that
what is seen hath not been made out of things
which do appear." (Heb. 11:3.) The term it
applies to this is Creation. It gives also a circumstantial
account of the coming of the present
order as we have it, closing with man's creation.</p>


<h4>EVOLUTION'S INTERPRETATION OF THE BIBLE.</h4>

<p>In order to bring the evolutionary theories
within the possibility of Bible sanction, a theory
of interpretation is adopted which calls the narratives
of Creation and the Fall myths, legends,
allegories, parables, "scenic representation," or
"idealized history" according to the theological
bias of the interpreter. These all amount to
the same thing, for they do away with the historical
value of the accounts. It is only a play upon
words to say they are "parables" for parables are
not unhistorical. Every one of Christ's parables is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
true to life and facts. It is claimed that the Bible
narratives are poetry and therefore are not historical.
The evolutionist for his purpose confounds
poetry and fiction. They are not synonymous.
A poetical form does not imply fictitiousness.
The Psalms have much history under their
poetical form. But the first chapter of Genesis is
not poetry. Hebrew poetry has a well-defined
form as seen in the poetical books. This chapter
does not conform to that form, and accordingly it
is printed not in poetical form but as prose in the
Revised Version. The mere repetition of certain
phrases is not the mark of poetry, but is characteristic
of the oriental languages in which the Bible
was written.</p>

<p>But who is to decide what in the Bible is historical
and what is not? What is to hinder anyone
from so discarding any fact whatever in the
Bible? Why has not the enemy of Christianity
the same right to apply this reasoning to the accounts
of the death and resurrection of Christ?
Where will this process end? The proclaimer of
such theories is putting a weapon into the hands
of the opponent of Christianity that he will use
one day to the destruction of the faith of many.
Once having permission to apply these terms, it is
easy to make these narratives, or anything else in
the Bible, mean anything or nothing as is desired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
As an ancient writer said, "Twenty doctors can
make a text read twenty different ways." We
protest against this loose method of interpretation
for many reasons:</p>

<p>1. We object to every new theory interpreting
the Bible to suit itself.</p>

<p>2. There is not the slightest warrant in these
narratives or elsewhere for such interpretation.
They are given as facts and are always so treated.
Creation and the Fall are everywhere spoken of
as actual facts both by Christ and all other Scripture
writers.</p>

<p>3. It is on this system of interpretation that
every false system rests, such as Mormonism. All
the modern vagaries support themselves from
Scripture by accommodation of its language to
their doctrines.</p>

<p>4. The Bible is not a book of puzzles, a delphic
oracle, to be read in any way suited to the occasion
or desires. It has a plain meaning and is
for everyday people and everyday needs.</p>

<p>5. The acceptance of the Bible account as unquestioned
fact and the literal interpretation of it
by Christ and his apostles ought to be enough for
anyone calling himself Christian or even for any
other who will accept good human testimony.
These writers were 1900 years nearer the date of
the events in question than we. They had access<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
to knowledge now lost to us. From any standpoint,
we may rest our view of these narratives on
the testimony of the New Testament Scriptures.
The references of the New Testament to the Old
are numbered by hundreds. Any Bible with references,
or any text book or Bible with Helps will
show these. It is enough here to give those
Christ refers to.</p>

<p>Christ himself cites from twelve books and
about twenty-four narratives as follows: Creation,
Matt. 19:4; Law of Marriage, Matt. 19:5; Cain
and Abel, Matt. 23:35; The Deluge, Matt. 24:37;
Abraham, John 8:56; Sodom and Gomorrah and
Lot's wife, Luke 17:28-32; Manna, John 6:49;
Brazen Serpent, John 3:14; Shew Bread, Matt.
12:3, 4; Elijah and his Miracles, Luke 4:25, 26;
Naaman, Luke 4:27; Tyre and Sidon, Matt. 11:22;
Jonah and "The Whale," Matt. 12:39; The Books
of Moses, John 5:46; The Psalms, Luke 20:42;
Moses and The Prophets, Luke 24:27; Isaiah,
Matt. 13:14; Daniel's Prophecies, Matt. 24:15;
Malachi, Matt. 11:10; The entire Old Testament,
Luke 24:44. Of not one of these does he convey
the slightest hint of aught but trustworthiness
and literal interpretation.</p>

<p>6. The still more serious issue is presented of
asserting that both Paul and Christ either did not
know that these were myths, or knowing so gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
no intimation that they used them in any way other
than as true narratives. This would not only
shake all confidence in Christ as divine and his
apostles as inspired, but would shake all confidence
in any fact or teaching from Scripture
whatever. For Scripture rests on facts and these
facts on witnesses. To these, appeal is constantly
made. On the truth of these all depends. Here
then is a "mythical" Adam made the basis of marriage;
a "mythical" Adam and his fall, the argument
for man's need and Christ's work, and the
same "mythical" Adam made the proof of the
resurrection. In short the whole system of Bible
truth is attacked by these theories, from credibility
in Christ himself to the last hope of the believer
in the world to come.</p>

<p>Whom shall we believe? Shall we credit Evolution
which admits that its theory is unproven
and full of difficulties, with not a single case of
Evolution to support it, nor a power which could
produce it, and with countless facts to antagonize
it, or shall we believe Jesus Christ who was never
mistaken, or false in his facts, or teachings, and
who believed these chapters, cited them and accepted
their narratives without question?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>


<h4>EVOLUTION AND BIBLE DOCTRINES.</h4>

<p>We have arrived at the vital point in this discussion.
If Evolution were only a scientific question,
it would interest a limited circle. As a deeply
religious question it interests all. That Evolution
affects vitally all evangelical belief is apparent
to the most superficial inquirer. It is not only
a matter of historic fact but of doctrinal teaching.
Man's nature and need as a descendant from the
brute is one thing, and as a spiritual being, fallen
from the likeness of God, another. The responsibility
in either case is very different and therefore
has to do with eternal destiny for weal or woe,
and also with the work of Christ.</p>

<p>The theology of the Higher Criticism which is
also the theology of Evolution, of which it is the
Biblical branch, is thus summed up by an evolutionary
writer, in a recent article giving the articles
of belief of the theology of Evolution: "The
Bible can no longer speak with unquestioned authority....
Poor old Adam disappears....
Christ's divinity is only such as we may possess ...
the atonement is only such as we see in all
life and nature.... As to the future life we find
ourselves left very much in the dark.... We no
longer regard going to heaven as the center of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
interest." (Theodore D. Bacon quoted in <cite>Homiletic
Review</cite>, Nov. 1902.)</p>

<p>Evolution teaches, as stated by Dr. George A.
Gordon, of Boston: "Man's state and fate is on
account of the irrationality he has brought up
with him from the animal world." (<cite>Immortality
and the New Theodicy</cite>, p. 100.) The future
of man according to Evolution is that
as he has risen from the brute state he ought
not to be punished for his defects but rather rewarded
for having done so well. Evolution
teaches that man has in himself the elements of
his salvation. These if developed will produce
the change he needs for this world and that to
come. He will proceed on the same lines as he
has traveled to reach his present state. Development
is the Saviour of Evolution. The Bible says
that to develop man is to develop sin and, "Sin
when it is finished bringeth forth death." It requires
the intervention of the Supernatural in
Regeneration to save man. Evolution is self-saving.</p>

<p>The future is radically affected by the theory
of Evolution. The development of mankind is
its objective point. To bring man to a point of
development will bring the Kingdom of Heaven.
The fate of the individual is not made much of.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
He is sacrificed for the race or species. But while
not much is made of the individual the general
teaching is that somehow it will be well with all
at last. It is a fact that all universalists are
evolutionists. Evolution makes Heaven and Hell
terms which mean little or nothing. The present
social state of man is the great quest. Evolution
is a bridge which reaches neither shore. It
knows not whence man came nor where he goes.</p>

<p>1. The Bible rests its doctrines upon its facts.
There is no character in Scripture aside from
Christ upon whose historical character so much
Scripture doctrine depends as upon Adam. The
creation of man is made the basis for the sanctity
of marriage by Christ, who quotes the words of
the account in Genesis. (Matt. 19:4-6; Mark
10:6-9.) Paul makes this narrative the basis of
his great argument for the state and need of man
and the work of Christ. "Through one man sin
entered into the world and death through sin....
Death reigned from Adam to Moses....
By the trespass of the one the many died ...
the judgment came of one unto condemnation
... as through the one man's disobedience the
many were made sinners, even so through the
obedience of the one shall the many be made
righteous." (Rom. 5:12-21, R. V.) Here the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
actuality of the narrative is the very basis of the
declaration of man's state in sin and a type of
the extent and nature of Christ's work. So also
the use by Paul in the account of the resurrection
doctrine: "As in Adam all die, so also in Christ
shall all be made alive." (1 Cor. 15:22-45.)</p>

<p>2. The Bible teaches that man was made in
the image of God. That image was Christ who
is elsewhere declared to be "the effulgence of his
glory and the very image of his substance."
(Heb. 1:3.) In this image man was made. This
is a very different picture presented to us from
that given by the evolutionist of a brute "which
could stand on its hind legs and throw things with
its forelegs."</p>

<p>3. The Bible teaches that all are guilty and
condemned and lost, and without excuse. It
teaches that man fell from a high state as a race
and as a race is responsible for his condition. It
cites death as the proof of this. It teaches that
man is inherently averse to God by nature and
wilfully continues to do wrong and in short is
condemned and lost. It teaches that he once had
the truth and wilfully gave it up for sin. That
he does so now in spite of the law of God written
in his conscience and that out of Christ he is lost
and without hope. (Rom. 1-5; Ep. 2:1-3, 11, 12.)</p>

<p>4. The Bible teaches that what man needs is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
pardon, a reconciliation with God, a ransom, a
regeneration, a resurrection. He must be translated
from death to life, from the kingdom of
darkness to that of light. If he has not all this
he is lost and doomed.</p>

<p>5. The Bible teaches that in order that man
might enjoy this, Christ had to come and die, "the
just for the unjust that he might bring us to
God." He died as a sacrifice, as an offering, as a
ransom, as a propitiation, as a reconciliation. His
death made it possible in justice as well as in
mercy to save man.</p>

<p>6. The Bible gives a description of man's means
of salvation which is most opposite to the hope
held out by Evolution. It is by a radical and supernatural
change that he becomes right and only
as all men so change or are changed will the
world become right. Conversion is not Evolution
but regeneration, the implanting of a new and
opposite nature.</p>

<p>7. The Bible teaches a different outcome of human
life and history. It points to an end by supernatural
means to the world and a judgment
for mankind and the establishment of the Kingdom
of Heaven by supernatural means. It cites
the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the
Deluge as examples of the world's end. It gives
the most awful combination of earthly figures as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the picture of the doom of the impenitent and the
most beautiful figures earth and sky can furnish
or the mind of man conceive as the home of the
saved. Nothing could be more different than the
theologies of Evolution and of the Bible.</p>

<p>Many well-meant volumes have been written
to reconcile Evolution and evangelical belief.
None are satisfying, although the eagerness with
which some were at first received are witness to
the desire to retain both beliefs.</p>

<p>The theistic evolutionist thinks that to find a
place for the Creator somewhere along the line is
enough. St. James rebukes this insufficient theology
in these words: "Thou believest that there
is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe,
and tremble." (Jas. 2:19.) So also Christ
himself said: "Ye believe in God believe also in
me.... I am the way, the truth and the life....
No man cometh unto the Father but by me....
He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the
Father which hath sent him.... For as the
Father hath life in himself even so gave he to the
Son also to have life in himself.... He hath
committed all judgment unto the Son that all men
may honor the Son even as they honor the
Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth
not the Father." Theism then is not enough in
the opinion of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole Christian system is in question in
this theory. The whole aim of Evolution is to
dispose of the supernatural as much as possible.
The radical evolutionist gets rid of God entirely
he thinks. The theistic evolutionist limits the interference
of the supernatural to the creation of
matter, of life, of man's spiritual nature, and the
incarnation and work of Christ. The tendency of
evolution is to make the miracles of Christ mythical
and the phenomena of conversion natural.
The theistic evolutionist is on a side hill. He
must go up or down. He is not consistent, and,
as the human mind asserts its right to consistency,
he is forced, willingly or unwillingly, often
unconsciously, to the one side or the other, and
he finds himself led along lines which take him
far from evangelical belief. In its consistent
form, Evolution leaves no room for a Creator.
Indeed Haeckel, the greatest of living evolutionists
and the legitimate successor to Darwin's
place and greatness, states, as already quoted,
thus: "It entirely excludes supernatural process,
every prearranged and conscious act of a personal
character. Nothing will make the full meaning
of the theory of descent clearer than calling it the
non-miraculous theory of creation." (<cite>History of
Creation</cite>, pp. 397, 422.) Another evolutionist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Carl Vogt, says: "Evolution turns the Creator
out of doors." Infidels all accept of it gladly.
Every atheist is an evolutionist.</p>


<h4>EVOLUTION A RELIC OF HEATHENISM.</h4>

<p>James Freeman Clark thus writes: "In the
system of the Greek and Scandinavian mythology,
spirit is evolved from matter; matter up to spirit
works. They begin with the lowest form of being;
night, chaos, a mundane egg, and evolve the
higher gods therefrom." (<cite>Ten Great Religions</cite>,
p. 231.)</p>

<p>Sir J. William Dawson, the late eminent geologist
of Canada, writes of the theory as follows:
"The evolutionist doctrine is one of the strangest
phenomena of humanity. It existed most naturally
in the oldest philosophy and poetry, in connection
with the crudest and most uncritical attempts
of the human mind to grasp the system of
nature; but that in our day a system destitute of
any shadow of proof, and supported merely by
vague analogies and figures of speech and by arbitrary
and artificial coherence of its own parts,
should be accepted as a philosophy and should
find able adherents to string upon its thread of
hypothesis our vast and weighty stores of knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
is surpassingly strange." (<cite>Story of the
Earth and Man</cite>, p. 317.)</p>

<p>Evolution is working towards a pantheistic
atheism. This is expressed in the creed of the late
Cecil Rhodes, the late magnate of South Africa,
as follows: "I believe in Force Almighty, the
ruler of the universe, working scientifically
through natural selection to bring about the survival
of the fittest and the elimination of the unfit."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE SPIRITUAL EFFECT OF EVOLUTION.</h3>


<p>It is apparent that the adoption of such a theory
as Evolution must affect the spiritual state of
the person receiving it. Man's mental and spiritual
natures are intimately connected. While
those in a settled previous spiritual experience
may carry Evolution as "a working theory" only,
those in an immature state will be vitally affected.
Especially is this true of youthful minds. It is
indeed a fact that many young men have started
with high purposes to prepare for the ministry,
and even for foreign missions, and have, after
adopting these modern theories, abandoned their
purpose, and thousands have abandoned all personal
religion. Pastors can tell of many such
instances.</p>

<p>Some have said that the adoption of Evolution
has helped their faith. They fail to see that
bringing the Bible down to their faith is not
bringing their faith up to the Bible. It is a weakening
of faith and not a strengthening of it. This
apparent increase of faith simply prepares the
way for its utter ruin. The first step leads to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
wider divergence, as many have shown, that leads
to wreck of all faith in a supernatural God or
world or Bible. The mind will follow its natural
workings. Loss of faith in the facts of the Bible
leads to loss of faith in its truths. The acceptance
of this theory still further leads to a lessening of
the sense of our need of Christ that the Bible
teaches and man should feel. And further the acceptance
of this theory, while it may not affect
materially the minds of experienced Christians,
will through them affect others.</p>

<p>There is also a latent unconscious loss of faith
that is realized only in some great emergency,
when in "the storm and stress" of life the soul
looks out for something to hold to. It is then
that the rotting platform of unbelief goes down in
wreck. The other extreme is also a cause of ruin.
In the time of great prosperity when all the
allurements of life and time and sense present
themselves, it requires all the purpose one has to
stem the tide of temptations. It is here that a
false belief will work havoc. The mind conceives
that after all sin is not so hateful or salvation so
needed or doom so fearful.</p>

<p>The effect on experimental personal experience
is evident. Instead of looking for a regeneration,
a revolution of the inner state, the believer in
Evolution necessarily looks for a change from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
education or other form of development. Such a
thing as conversion or a baptism of the Holy
Ghost he will cease to look for or desire. There
will come declining feeling, lessening devotion,
prayer will become perfunctory and there will
come increasing occupation with and love for
other things. Evolution as a belief makes right
many things that were before held to be wrong.
It is an easy religion to hold. It strikes the world
at the angle of least resistance and enables the
holder to accept almost anything that the natural
man desires. The conflict of "the flesh and the
spirit" ceases; the flesh, that is the natural man,
has conquered.</p>

<p>These theories in many seem to be but evidences
of a previous wrong state of heart. The
wish is father to the thought. The theory is accepted
because it allows the laying aside of views
that restrain the desires. Such persons are willing
to admit the existence of God and his contact
with man at Creation if relieved from any nearer
relationship. It is therefore worse than unbelief.
It is antagonism. It is enmity. Christ said, "Men
love darkness rather than light because their
deeds are evil." The heart and life are the basis
of their opinions. It is evident that argument
here fails. "A man convinced against his will remains
an unbeliever still."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Evolution is a comfortable theory to the world.
It elevates man. It hides the presence of God.
It calls for no repentance or consecration. It
boasts of human progress and claims merit therefor.
In short it is the worship of man rather than
the worship of God. It deifies man and it ignores
Christ. Once committed to this theory, there is
no extreme the person may not reach. Some have
abandoned Christ and Christianity because of it.
It is in fact in doctrine and experience and conduct,
the antithesis of Christianity.</p>

<p>Such a theory as Evolution and its vaporizing
method of Bible interpretation, prepares the way
for "isms" of every kind. It is to this we are indebted
for the swarm of these that afflicts the
church to-day. Once allow that the Bible may
be interpreted to suit such theories and any heresy
or absurdity can prove its position from the Bible
as all of them by this same process do.</p>

<p>It is already weakening the power of the pulpit,
and this in turn is one great reason for the declining
effect of the preached word. Once received
into a minister's heart the edge of his sword is
dulled if indeed the sword is not itself sheathed.
He may not preach Evolution either as a method
of creation or a method of salvation, but his own
inner faith is weakened in the old truth which had
such power to convert the souls of hearers. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
openly advocated and taught, it is useless to seek
revivals among those so taught. So it is the fact
that conversions to-day are mainly confined to
the young and others not affected by the error.</p>

<p>All the indications point to the further weakening
of the hold upon men of the supernatural and
the eternal. To eliminate the former and, while
acknowledging the latter, to disparage all reference
to the future life, seems to be the tendency
of the day. As already cited, one of its chief advocates
tells us, "Heaven is no longer the center
of the Christian's hope." The consequence is the
material and intellectual interests receive chief attention
and other agencies take the chief place
religion should have. Education received in the
United States over $200,000,000 in gifts during
the last few years, to say nothing of the many fold
more received from incomes and public funds.
Meanwhile the causes of Christ are languishing,
missions are dwarfed, small churches in great
masses of the population are struggling for existence
against fearful odds, while the money of
professed Christians pours in these mighty
streams for all other purposes. No sensible person
will disparage education, but "Religion is the
chief concern of mortals here below."</p>

<p>Further it is the few who can take advantage
of the higher education for which these millions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
are given. But five per cent of the common
school scholars can attend college. The many
must toil for existence. It is to the poor the gospel
was preached by its Founder. It is to the
poor it means most. To those who have little
else it is the all in all. It is to these it should be
preached in its freedom and fullness. The principles
of natural selection of the fittest which
sends millions to higher institutions and neglects
the masses of the people is the opposite of the
gospel.</p>

<p>Cardinal Newman wrote: "There is a special
effort made almost all over the world, but most
visibly and formidably in its most civilized and
powerful part, to do without religion.... Truly
there is at this time a confederacy of evil marshalling
its hosts from all parts of the world, organizing
itself and taking measures enclosing the
church of Christ as in a net and preparing the
way for a general apostasy." (<cite>Quoted in "Christianity
and Anti-Christianity."</cite> S. J. Andrews,
p. 4.) Whether this is the final form of unbelief
is difficult to say. It bears the marks of anti-christianity
the apostle speaks of. The unbelief
of the latter days will rest on belief in the unvarying
stability of nature. (2 Peter 3:4.) The
coming of this theory is aimed to dissipate any
looking for supernatural changes such as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Scriptures teach are coming to earth, such as the
last day, the coming of Christ, the resurrection
and all the vast series of changes therein declared.
Hence that wholesome fear of God so
operative in deterring evil and stimulating good
is removed. Based on this unbelief, the enemy of
God and man can advance to the accomplishment
of his purposes as never before. All satanic
methods before this have been crude and coarse
compared with this last invention. It is the most
subtle and sweeping of all evil methods to ensnare
the mind of man. Based on what is called
science, promoted by the scholars of the day,
taught in the fountains of learning and preached
from pulpit and platform, it must have a widespread
effect. Heretofore attacks on Christianity
have been made from without. This is from within.
It is the trusted leaders who are now undermining
the fortress in which they live.</p>

<p>But revivals always begin at the bottom. It
was a few poor fishermen who commenced the
gospel age. It is their successors to whom we
must look as we have in the past for return of
apostolic power. "God chose the foolish things
of the world that He might put to shame them
that are wise; and God chose the weak things of
the world that He might put to shame the things
that are strong; and the base things of the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and the things that are despised did God choose,
yea and the things that are not, that he might
bring to naught the things that are: that no flesh
should glory before God." (1 Cor. 1:27, 28, R.
V.) So we look hopefully to God for that only
which will deliver the church from this and all
other pestilent evils, theoretical and practical, a revival
of true religion by the power of the Holy
Spirit, and the preaching of the old gospel of the
cross of Christ.</p>

<p class="center">An Examination of Its Evidences</p>



<p>With an introduction by George Frederick Wright, D.D., LL.D.,
Oberlin College.</p>

<p>This book undertakes to show that Evolution is not accepted by all
scientists and gives names of many who oppose it; that it is admittedly
an unproven theory; that it has never been verified and cannot
be; that not a single case has ever been known, or any cause by which
such changes could take place. Its arguments are fairly stated and
considered one by one. Over a hundred writers are cited, including
all the great evolutionists.</p>
